When you do the R切iewsof Etymologyexercises, make sure to fill in the English word containing the prefix, root, or suffix required-use a chapter word, or any other word that comes to mind. (Coin words if you like!) 
Pay special attention to the Chapter R切iews.sAre the words still fresh in your mind? Do you remember the meaning of each root studied in the previous sessions? In these R或ews,syou are not only testing your learning but also tightening up any areas in which you discover lacks, weaknesses, or lapsesof memory. 


2.smaster the pronunciation system!s
_Saying words aloud, and saying them right, is half the battle insfeeling comfortable and assured with all the new words you are going t. learn. Every word taught is respelled to show its pronun-ciation, so pay close attention to how the phonetic symbols work. 
(a)sFirst, master the "schwa"/s

Almost every English word of two or more syllables containssone or several syllables in which the vowel sound is said very quickly. For example: 
"Linda spoke to her mother about a different idea she had." 
.Read the previous sentence aloud at normal conversatio叫sspeed.s
Read it again. Listen to how the -a of Linda; the -er of mother; the a-of about; the -er and -ent of different; and the -a of idea sound. 
Very quick—very short! Right? Phonetically respelled, these words are represented as: 
1. Linda LIN.-do 

2.smothers·MU1'B:＇匀 
3.sabout仑BOWT's
4.sditf erentsDIF妞妞ts

S.sideaI-DEE勺
The芍mbols"a," called a schwa, represents the quick, short vowel sound in the five words above. 
双i



Now look back at the sentence preceded by an arrow. 
The italicized words are rewritten as: 
1. previo四 PREE'-vee-ase
2. sentence SEN'一tanse
3. aloud今LOWD'e


4. normal NAWR'-mal 
5. conversational kon'-var-SAY'-shan-al You will:find in almost all words that are phonetically 


respelled throughoua t this book. 
Say the five italicized words aloud and make sure you understand how the schwa (a) sounds. 
(b) Next, under劝andeaccent. 
Look at word (5) above: conversational: kon'-var-SAY'-shan-al.eNote that there are two accent marks, one on kon', another on SAY'. Note also that kon'is in lower-case letters, SAY'in capitals. Both syllables are stressed, but the one in capitals (SAY') sounds stronger (or louder) than the one in lower case (kon'). Say con-versational aloud, noting the difference. 
Say these three words, taken from Chapter 3, aloud, noticing the variation in stress between 
the lower-case and the capitalized syllables: 
1.eegomaniacal ee'-go-m己NI'－a-kole
2.ealtercation awl'-t:ir-KA Y'-sh:in 
3.eanthropologicalean'-thr:i-pa-LOJ'仑k:ile


(c)eBe careful of the letter "S" (or "s'') in phonetic respellings.eS (ores) is always hissed, as in see, some, such. After an -n, you will be tempted to buzz (or "voice") the -s, because final -ns is usually pronounced -nz, as in wins, tons, owns, etc. (Say these three words aloud一hearethe z at the end?) Resist the temptation! S (or s) is always hissed in phonetic respellings! 
Say these words aloud:

3. a word (or words) on western and eastern pronunciation 

In the New York City area, and in parts of New Jersey and other eastern states, the syllables -ar, -er, -or, -off, and -aw are pronounced somewhat differently from the way they are said in the Midwest and in the West. 
In New York City, for example, the words below are generally pronounced as follows: 
orange AHR'-anj tallc TAWK coffee KAW'-fee sorority sa-RAHR'-;-tee incorrigible in-KAHR宅j今加1 disparage dis-PAR'－司(A asin HAT) merry 
MER'-ee (E as in WET) marry MAR'-ee (A as in HAT) astronaut AS'-tr今nawt' Harry HAR'-ee (A as in HAT) 


In the Midwest and West, on the other hand, the same words areusually said approximately as follows: 
orange AWR'-:;inj 
talk TOK coffee KOF'-ee sorority sa-RAWR'-:;i-tee 

incorrigible in-KA WR'-:;i一ja-bal 
disparage dis-PA皿司 merry MAIR'-ee marry MAIR＇一ee 
astronaut AS'-tr今not' Harry HAIR＇一ee 
Nothing so radical here that a person brought up in Brooklyn or the Bronx cannot understand a native of Los Angeles or San Francisco—it's just that each one thinks the other has an ac-cent! 
In California, for example, Mary, merry, and marry sound al-



most exactly alike--in New York, they are usually heard as quitedilierent words. 
(So, to be sexist for a moment, if the men at a party in Manhat-tan say, "Let's all make merry!", Mary doesn't feel that she is about to seduced by the males!) 

In the phonetic,respellings throughout the book, the'J{estem pronunciations of words with the syllables remarked on above are used. This is done largely because I myself have lived in the Los Angeles area for some fourteen years, and have had to retrain my pronunciation (having come from New York City, where I was born, and lived all my life until 1964) so that my friends and stu-dents would stop making fun of the way I speak. Neither form of pronunciation is any better any more euphonious than the other. 
Throughout the country, pronun-nor ciation varies not only from region to region or state to state, but often from city to city! The changes are slight and subtle, but they 
do exist, and an expert can easily pinpoint the geographical source of a person's language patterns almost down to a few square_ miles m area. 
If yon are an Easterner, you will have no difficulty translating the pronunciations of weirds lilce .orority, inco示gible,edisparage, and astronaut (all words discussed in later chapters) into your own comfortable language patterns. 
4.ewhy etymology?e
Etymolo盯（et'-a-MOL令-jee)edeals with the· origin 
or deriva-tion of words. 
When you know the meaning of a root (for example, Latin ego, I or self), you can better understand, and more easily remember, all the words built on this root. 
Learn one root and you加veethe key that will血lockethe mean-ings of up to ten or twen句WOT心切whichethe root appears. Learn ego and you can immediately get a handle on egocentric,egomaniac, egoist, egotist, and alter ego. Learn anthropos (Greek, mankind), and you will. quickly un-derstand, and never forget, anthropolo盯，misanthropy,eanthropoid, 




anthropocentric, anthropomorphic, philanthropy, and anthropo-phobia. Meet any word with anthropo-in it, and you will have at least some idea of its meaning. 

In the etymological (e心m:i-LOJ'于bl)oapproach to vocabu-lary building: 

.oYou willleam about pr.肛es,oroots, and suffixes一 
.oYou will be able to figure ont unfamiliar words by recognizingotheir structure, the building blocks. from which they are con-structed一o
.oYou will 
be able to construct words correctly by learning tooput these building blocks together in the proper way-ando
.oYou will be able to derive verbs from nouns, nouns andoverbs from adjectives, adjectives from nouns, etc.-and do allothis correctly.o



Learn how to deal with etymology and you will feel comfortable with words一youowill use new words with self-assurance--you will be able to figure out tho四andsoof words you hear or read even if you加veonever heard or seen these words before. 
That's why the best approach to new words is through etymol-ogy牛－asoyou will discover for yourself as soon as you start to work on chapter 31 

5. but what are nouns, verbs, and adjectives? 
You probably know.o
But if you don't, you can master these parts of speech.(and ref-erence will be made to noun forms, verb forms, and adjective forms throughout the book) within the next five minutes. 
(a)oA noun is a word that can be preceded by a, an, the, some,o
such, or my. An egoist (noun) 

i Incidentally, Latin scholars will notice that I present a Latin verb in the first person singular, present tense (verto, I tum), but call it an infinitive (verto, to turn). I do this for two reasons: 1) verto is easier for a non-Latin scholar to pronounce (the actual infinitive, vertere, is pronouncedWAIR屯ray);oand 2) when I studied Latin fifty years ago, the convention was to refer to, a verb by using the first person singular, present tense. 
If you are not a Latin scholar, you need not bother to read this foot-note-if you've already done so, forget it! 



Such asceticism (noun) 
The misogynist (noun) 
(Nouns, you will discover, often end in conventional suffixes: -ne灯，－ity,e-ism, -y, -ion, etc.)e
(b)eA verb is a word that fits into the pattern,''Let use
" A verb has a past tense. Let us equivocate (verb)—past tense: equivocated. Let us alternate (verb)-past tense: alternated. Let us philander (verb)一pastetense: philandered. (Verbs, you will discover, often end in conventional suffixes: 
-ate, -ize, -fy, etc.)e
(c)eAn adjective is a word that fits into the pattern, "You are
“ 
very 
You are very egoistic (adjective). 
You are very introverted (adjective). 
You are very miso盯nouse·c adjective). 
(Adjectives, you will discover, often end in conventional suffixes:'-ic,-ed,-ous, -al,-ive, etc.) 
And adverbs, of course, are萨nerallyeformed by adding -ly to an adjective: misogynous-miso幻'nous忱eeducational-education-ally; etc.

If you intend to work with this book seriously (that is, if youreclear intention is to add a thousand or more new words to your present vocabulary-add them permanently, unforgettably-add them so successfully that you will soon find yourself using them in speech and writing), I suggest that you give yourself every advan-tage by carefully following the laws of learning: 
(a)eSpace your learning.e
Beginning with Chapter 3, every chapter will be divided intoe"sessions." Each session may take one half hour to an hour and a half, depending on the amount of material and on your own speed of learning. 



Do one or two sessions at a time-three if you're going strong 
and are all involved—and always decide when you stop exactly when you will return. (I remind you to do this later in the book, since such a procedure is of crucial importance.) 
(b)eDo not rush—go at your own comfortable speed.e
Everyone learns at a different pace. Fast learners are no betterethan slow learners-it's the end result that counts, not the time it takes you to finish. 
(c) Review.e
When you start a new session, go back to the last exercise of the previous session (usually Can you recall the words? or Chapter Review), cover your answers, and test your retention一doeyou 
have quick recall after a day or so has elapsed? 
(d) Test yourself.eYou are not aiming for a grade, or putting your worth on thee
13, and 17)—rather you are discovering your weaknesses, if any; 
line, when you take the three Comprehens.ve Tests (Chapters 8, deciding where repairs have to be made; and, especially, ex-periencing a feeling of success at work well done. (In learning, too, nothing succeeds like success!) Use these three tests, as well as the abundant drill exercises, as aids to learning. No one is perfect, no one learns in the exact same way or at the same rl)te as anyone else. Find the optimum tech-nique and speed for your unique learning patterns-and then give yourself every opportunity to exploit your actual, latent, and po-tential abilities. 

But most important (as I will remind you several times throughout the book)-develop a routine and stick to it!

HOW TO TEST YOUR PRESENT VOCABULARY 



Once-asa child—you were an expert, an accomplished virtuoso, at learning new words. Today, by comparison, you are a rank and bumbling amateur. 

Does this statement sound insulting? It may be--but if you are the average adult, it is a statement that is, unfortunately, only too true. 
Educational testing indicates that children of ten who have grown up in families in which English is the native language have recognition vocabularies of over twenty thousand words
— 
And that these same ten-year-olds have been learning new words at a rate of many hundreds a year since the age of four. 
In astonishing contrast, studies show that adults who are no longer attending-school increase their vocabularies at a pace slower than twenty-five to fifty words annually. 

How do you assess your own vocabulary? 
Is it quantitatively healthy? 
Rich in over-all range? 

Responsive to any situation in which you may find yoursel疗s
Truly indicative of your intellectual potential? 
More important, is it still growing at the same rapid clip as when you were a child? 
Or, as with most adults, has your rate of increase dropped dras-



tica11y since you left school? And if so, do you now feel that your vocabulary is somewhat limited, your verbal skills not as sharp as you would like them to be? 
Let us check it out. I challenge you to a series of tests that will measure your vocab-ulary range, as well as your verbal speed and responsiveness.

VOCABULARY AND SUCCESS 
Now you know where you stand. If you are in the below aver-age or average group, you must consider, seriously, whether an in-adequate vocabulary may be holding you back.(If you tested out on the above average, excellent, or superior level, you have doubt-less already discovered the unique and far-reaching value of a rich vocabulary, and you are .ager to add still further to your knowl-edge of words.) 
Let us examine, briefly, some of the evidence that points to the close relationship between vocabulary and personal, professional, and intellectual growth. 
The Human Engineering Laboratory found that the only com-mon characteristic of successful people in this country is an unu-sual grasp of the meanings of words. The Laboratory tested the vocabularies of thousands of people in all age groups. and in all walks of life-and discovered that those people drawing down the highest salaries made the highest scores. Consider very thought-fully the explanation that the director of the Laboratory offered for the relationship between vocabulary and success: 
"Why do large vocabularies characterize executives and possi-bly outstanding inen and women in other fields? The final answer seems to be that words are the instruments 
by means of which men and women grasp· the thoughts of others and with which they do much of their own thinking. They are the tools of thought." 
There is other evidence. 
At many universities, groups of freshmen were put into experi-mental classes for the sole purpose of increasing their knowledge of English words. These groups did better in their sophomore, junior, and senior years than control groups of similarly endowed students who did not receive such training. 







17 


And still more evidence: 
At the University of Illinois, entering students were given a sim-pie twenty-nine-word vocabulary test.九eeresults of this test could be used, according to Professor William D. Templeman, to make an accurate prediction of future academic success--or lack of success-over the entire four year college course. "If a student has a superior vocabulary," states Professor Templeman, "it will probably follow that he will do better work academically." 

And finally: Educational research has discovered that your I.Q. is intimately 
related to your vocabulary. Take a standard vocabulary test and then an intelligence test—the results in both will be substantially 
the same. YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR VOCABULA.Y 

The more extensive your vocabulary, the better your chances for success, other things being equal—success in attaining your educational goals, success in moving ahead in your business or pro-fessional career, success in achieving your intellectual potential. And you can increase your vocabulary—faster and easier than you may realize. You can, in fact, accomplish a tremendous gain in less than two 

to three months of concentrated effort, even if you do only one session a day—in less time if you do two or more sessions a day. 
Furthermore--You can start improving your vocabulary immediately-and within a few days you can be cruising along at such a rapid rate that there will be an actual change in your thinking, in your ability to express your thoughts, and in your powers of understanding. Does this sound as if I am promising you the whole world in a neat package with a pretty pink ribbon tied around it? I am. And I am willing to make such an unqualified promise because I have seen what happens to those of my students at New York Univer-sity and at Rio Hondo College in W垃ttier,eCalifornia, who make sincere, methodical efforts to learn more, many ip.ore, words.

HOW TO START BUILDING YOUR VOCABULARY 

When you have finished working with this book, you will no 
longer be the same person. 

You can't be. 
If you honestly read every page, if you do every exercise, if you 
take every test, if you follow every principle, you will go through an intellectual experience that will effect a radical change in you. 
For if you systematically increase your vocabulary, you will also sharpen and enrich your thinking; push back your intellectual ho-rizons; build your self-assurance; improve your facility in handling the English language and thereby your ability to express your thoughts effectively; and acquire a deeper understanding of the world in general and of yourself in particular. 

Increasing your vocabulary does not mean merely learning the definitions of large numbers of obscure words; it does not mean memorizing.scores of unrelated terms. What it means--what it can only mean一is becoming acquainted with the multitudinous and fascinating phenomena of. human existence for which words are, obviously, only the verbal descriptions. 

Increasing your vocabulary一properly, intelligently, and sys-tematically一means treating yourself to an all-round, liberal edu-cation. 




And surely you cannot deny that such an experience will change you intellectually— 
Will have a discernible effect on your methods of thinking--on your store of information--0n your ability to express your ideas -on your understanding of human problems. 

HOW CHILDREN INCREASE THEIR VOCABULARIES 
The typical ten-year-old, you will recall, has a recognition vo-cabulary of over twenty thousand words一andehas been learning many hundreds of new words every year since the age of four. 
You were once that typical child. 
You were once an accomplished virtuoso at vocabulary build-ing. What was your secret? Did you spend hours every day poring over a dictionary? Did you lull yourself to sleep at night with Webster's Un-
abridged? Did you keep notebooks foll of all the new words you ever heard or read? Did you immediately look up the meaning of any new word that your parents or older members of your family used? Such procedures would have struck you as absurd then, as ab-surd as they would be for you today. You·had a much better, much more effective, and considerably less self-conscious method. 



Your method was the essence of simplicity: day in and day out you kept learning; you kept squeezing every possible ounce of learning out of every waking moment; you were an eternal qoes-tion box, for you had a constant and insatiable desire to know and understand. 




HOW ADULTS STOP BUILDING THEIR VOCABULARIES 

Then, eventually, at some point in your adult life (unless you are the rare exception), you gradually lost your compulsive drive to discover, to figure out, to understand, to know. 

Eventually, therefore, you gradually lost your need to increase your vocabulary一youreneed to learn the words that could verbal-ize your new discoveries, your new understanding, your new knowledge. 
Roland Gelatt, in a review of Caroline Pratt's book I Learn from Children, describes this phenomenon as follows: 
All normal human beings are born with a powerful urge to learn. Almost all of them lose this urge, even before they have reached 
maturity. It is only the few... who are so constituted that lack of learning becomes a nuisance. This is perhaps the most insidious o! human tragedies. 
Children are wonders at increasing their vocabularies because of their "powerful urge to learn." They do not learn solely by 
means of words, but as their knowledge increases, so does their voca.ulary—for words are the symbols of.ideas,andunder-
.standing. 
(If you are a parent, you perhaps remember that crucial · and trying period in which your child constantly asked "Why?" The "Why?" is the child's method of finding out. How many adults that you know go about asking and thinking "Why?" How· often do you yourself do it?) 
The adults who "lose this urge," who no longer feel that "lack of learning becomes a nuisance,"stop building their vocabularies. They stop learning, they stop growing intellectual1y, they 
stop changing. When and if such a time comes, then, as Mr. Gelatt so truly says, "This is perhaps the most insidious of human trage-dies." But fortunately the process is far from irreversible. 




If you have lost the "powerful urge to learn," you can regainit—you can regain your need to discover, to figure out, to under-stand, to know. 
And thus you can start increasing your vocabulary at the same 
rate as when you were a child. 
I am not spouting airy theory. For over thirty-five years I have worked with thousands of adults in my college courses in vocabu-lary improvement, and、Iecans纽teeas a fact, and without qualifica-
tion, that: 
If you can recapture the "powerful urge to learn" with which you were born, you can go on increasing your vocabu加-yeat a pro-digious rate一 
No matter what your present age. 
WHY AGE MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN VOCABULARY BUILDING 
I repeat, no matter what your present age. You may be laboring under a delusion common to many older people. You may think that after you pass your twenties you rapidly and inevitably lose your ability to learn. 

That is simply not true. 
There is no doubt that the years up to eighteen or twenty are the best period for learning. Your own experience no doubt bears that out. And of course for most people more learning goes on faster up to the age of eighteen or twenty than ever after, even if they live to be oIder than Methuselah. （That is w?y vocabuIary increases so rapidly for the first twenty years of Iife1 and compara-tively at a snail's pace thereafter.) 
But (and follow me closely)一e
The fact that most learning is accomplished before the age of twenty does not mean that very little)earning can be achieved be-yond that age. 
W血teis done by most people and what can be done under proper guidance and motivation are two very, very different things -asescientific experiments have conclusively shown. 


Furthermore--

The fact that your learning ability may be best up to age twenty does not mean that it is absolutely useless as soon as your twenti-eth birthday is passed. 
Quite the contrary. Edward Thorndike, the famous educational psychologist, found in experiments with people of all ages that although the learning 
. curve rises spectacularly up to twenty, it remains steady for at least another five years. After that, ability to learn (according to Professor Thorndike) drops very, very slowly up to the age of thirty-five, and drops a bit more but still slowly beyond that age. 
And一 Right up to senility the total decrease in learning ability after age twenty is never more than 15 per cent! That does not sound, I submit, as if no one can ever learn any-thing new after the age of twenty. Believe me, the old saw that claims you cannot teach an old dog new tricks is a baseless, if popular, superstition. 


So I repeat: no matter what your age, you can go on learning efficiently, or start learning once again if perhaps you have stopped. 
You can be thirty, or forty, or fifty, or sixty, or seventy--or older. 

No matter what your age, you can once again increase your vo-cabulary at a prodigious rate一providingeyou recapture the''pow-erftil urge to learn" that is the key to vocabulary improvement. 
Not the urge to learn "words”—words are only symbols of ideas. But the urge to learn facts, theories, concepts, information, knowledge, understanding--call it what you will. 
Words are the symbols of knowledge, the keys to accurate thinking. Is it any wonder then that the most successful and intel-ligent people in this country have the biggest vocabularies? 
It was not their large vocabularies that made these people suc-
cessful and inte11igent, but their knowledge. Knowledge, however, is gained largely through words. In the process of increasing their knowledge, these successful 


people increased their vocabularies. Just as children increase their vocabulary at a tremendous, phe-










nomenal rate during those years when their knowledge is increas-ing most rapidly. 
Knowledge is chiefly in the form of words, and from now on, in this book, you will be thinking about, and thinking with, new words and new ideas. 

WHAT THIS BOOK CAN DO FOR YOU , 
This book is designed to get you started building your vocabu-lary--effectively and at jet-propelled speed一byehelping you re-gain the intellectual atmosphere, the keen, insatiable curiosity, the "powerful urge to learn" of your childhood. 
The organization of the book is based on two simple principles: 
1) words are the verbal symbols of ideas, and 2) the more ideaseyou are familiar with, the more words you know.e
So, chapter by chapter, we will start witl1 some central idea— personality types, doctors, science, unusual occupations, liars, ac-tions, speech habits, insults, compliments, etc.-and examine ten basic words that express various aspects of the idea. Then, using each word as a springboard, we will explore any others which are related to it in meaning or derivation, so that it is not unlikely that a single chapter may discuss, teach, and test close to one hundred important words. 

Always, however, the approach will be from the idea. First there will be a "teaser preview'.'in which the ideas are briefiy hinted at; then a "headline," in which each idea is examined somewhat more closely; next a clear, detailed paragraph or more will analyze the idea in all its ramifications;finally the word itself, which you will meet only after you are completely familiar with the idea. 
In the etymology (derivation of words) section, you will learn what Greek or Latin root gives the word its unique meaning and what other words contain the same, or related, roots. You will thus be continually working in related fields, and there will never be any possi'bility of confusion from "too muchness," despite the great number of words taken up and tested in each chapter. 
Successful people have superior vocabularies. People who are 


intellectually alive and successful in the professional or business worlds are accustomed to dealing with ideas, are constantly on the search for new ideas, build their lives and their careers on the ideas they have learned. And it is to readers whose goal is success-ful living (in the broadest meaning of the word successful) that this book is addressed. 

A NOTE ON Tl从E SCHEDULES 
From my experience over 
many years in teaching, I have be-come a firm believer in setting a goal for all learning and a sched-ule for reaching that goal. 
You will discover that each chapter is. divided into approxi-mately equal sessions, and that each session will take from thirty to forty-five minutes of your time, depending on how rapidly or slowly you enjoy working一andebear in mind that every.ne has an optimum rate of learning. 
For best results, do one or two sessions at a time—spaced study-ing, with time between sessions so that you can assimilate what you have learned, is far more efficient, far more productive, than gobblingup great amounts in indigestiblechunks. 
Come back to the book every day, or as close to every day as the circumstances of your life permit. 
Find a schedule that is comfortable for you, and then stick to it. 
Avoid interrupting your work until you have completed a full session, and always decide, before you stop, exactly when you will plan to pick up the book again. 

Working at your own comfortable rate, you will likely finish the material in two to three months, give or take a few weeks either way. 
However long you take, you will end with a solid feeling of ac-complishment, a new understanding of how English words work, and—most important-how to make wor心workefor you.

SESSION 1 

Every human being is, in one way or another, unique. 
Everyone's personality is determined by a combination of ge-netic and environmental factors. 
Let us examine ten personality types (one of which might by chance be your very own) that result from the way culture, growth, family background, and environment interact with hered-ity. 

And, of course, we begin not with the words; but with the ideas. 

IDEAS 
1. me first 

Your attitude to life is simple, direct, and aboveboard一everyedecision you-make is based on the answer to one question: "What's in it for me?" If your selfishness, greed, and ruthless desire for self-advancement hurt other people, that's too bad. "This is a tough world, pal,dog eat dog and all that; and I, for one, am not going to be left behind!" 
An egoist 

2. the height of conceit 
"Now, let's see. Have you heard about all the money I'm mak-ing? Did I tell you about my latest amorous conquest?Let me give you my opinion一IeI.cnow, because I'm an expert at practically ev-erything!" You are boastful to the point of being obnoxious--you 



self; and on it you play a number of monotonous variations: what you think, what you have done, how good you are, how you would solve the problems of the world, etc.ead nauseam. 
_ An egotist 

3.elet me help youe
You have discovered the secret of true bappiness--concerningeyourself with the welfare of others. Never mind your· own inter-ests, how'_s the next fellow getting along? 
An altruist 

-4. leave me alone 
Like a biochemist studying a colony of bacteria under th. mi-croscope, you minutely examine your every thought, feeling, and action. Probing, futilequestions like "What do other people-think of me?", "How do I look?", and "Maybe I shouldn't have said that?" are your constant naggingcompanions, for you are unable to realize that other people do not spend as much time and energy analyzing you as you think. 
You may seem unsocial, yet your greatest desire is to be l_iked and accepted. You may be shy and quiet, you are often moody and unhappy, and you prefer solitude or at most the eompany of one person to a cl'Qwd. You have an aptitude for creative work and are uncomfortable engaging in activities that require co-operation with other people. You may even be a genius, or eve._tu-ally tum into 
one. 

An introvert 
5. let's do it togethere

You would be great as a teacher, counselor,administrator, in-surance agent; You can always become interested--sincerely, vi一 tally interested-in other people's problems. You're the life of the party, because you never wo可aboutethe effect of your actions, never inhibityourself with doubts about dignity or propriety. You 






generally full of high spirits; you love to be with people-lots of people. Your thoughts, your interests, your whole personality are turned outward. 
An extrovert 

6. neither extremee
You have both introverted and extroverted tendencies一ate
different tunes and on different occasions. Your interests are turned, in about equal proportions, both inward and outward. Jn.,. deed, you're quite normal一inethe sense that your personality is 
like that of most people. 
An ambivert 

7.epeople are no damn goode
Cynical,embittered,suspicious, you hate everyone. (Especially,ebut never to be admitted, yourself?) The perfectibility of the human race? "Nonsense! No way!" The stupidity, the meanness, and the crookedness of most mortals ("Most? Probably all!")一ethat is your favorite theme. 
A misanthrope 

8. wamen are no damn goode
Sometime in your dim past, you were crossed, scorned, or deeplyewounded by a woman (a mother, or mother figure, perhaps?). So now you have a carefully constructed defense agaim;t further hurt 一youehate all women. 
Amiso窃niste

9.e"marriage is an institution-and v:,ho wants to live in an institu-tion?"e

You will not make the ultimate legal commitment Members of the opposite sex are great as lovers, roommates, apartment-or house-sharers, but not as lawfully wedded spouses. The ties that 




bind are too binding for you. You may possibly believe, and pos-sibly, for yourself, be right, that a commitment is deeper and 
more meaningful if freedom is available without judicial proceedings. 
A misogamist 
10. "... that the flesh i. heir to... "o
Self-denial, austerity,lonely contemplation—these are the char-acteristics of the good life, so you claim. The simplest food and the least amount of it that will keep body and soul together, com-bined with abstinencefrom fleshly, earthly pleasures, will eventu-ally lead to spiritual perfection—that is your philosophy. 

An ascetic 

USING THE WORDS 
You have been -introduced to ten valuable words一butoin each case, as you have noticed, you have first considered the ideas that these words represent. Now say the words-each one is respelled phonetically so that you will be sure to pronounce it correctly.* 
Say each word aloud. This is the first important step to com-plete mastery.As you hear a word in your own voice, think of its meaning. Are you quite clear about it? If not, reinforce your leami,ng by rereading the explanatory paragraph or paragraphs.

SESSION 2 

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

Every word in the English language has a history一and these ten are no exception. In this section you will learn a good deal more about the.words you have been working with; in addition, you will make excursions into many other words allied eith.r in meaning, form, or history to our basic ten. 
1. the ego 

Egoist and egotist are built on the same Latin root-the pro-noun ego, meaning I. I is the greatest concern in the egoist's mind, the most overused word in the egotist's vocabulary. (Keep the 


words differe!}tiated in your own mind by thinking of the t in talk, and the additional t in egotist.) Ego itself has been taken over from Latin as an important English word and is commonly used to denote one's concept of oneself, as in, "What do you think 
your constant criticisms do to my ego?" Ego has also a special meaning in psychology—but for the moment you have ·enough problems without going into that. If you are an egocentl'ic (ee'-go-SEN'-trik), you consider your-self the center of the universe—you are an extreme form of the egoist. And if you are an egomaniac (ee'-go-MAY'-nee-ak), you carry egoism to such an extreme that your needs, desires, and in-terests have become a morbid obsession, a mania. The egoist or egotist is obnoxious, the egocentric is intolerable, and the egoma-血cois dangerous and slightly mad. Egocentric is both a noun ("What an egocentric her new room-mate is!") and an adjective ("He is the most egocentric person I have ever met!"). To derive the adjective form of egomaniac, add -al, a common adjective suffix. Say the adjective aloud: 


egomaniacal ee'-go-ma-NI'－a-kal 

2.oothers 
In Latin, the word for other is alter, and a number of valuable English words are built on this root. 
Altruism (AL'-tr<R>-iz勺m),othe philosophy.practiced by altru-ists, comes from one of the variant spellings of Latin alter, other. Altruistic (al-tr<X>-IS'-tik) actions look toward the benefit of others. If you alternate (AWL'七r-nayt'),oyou skip one and take the other, so to speak, as when you play golf on alternate (AWL'-阮n:it)oSaturdays. 
An alternate (AWL'七r-n:it)oin a debate, contest, or conven-
tioll is the other person who will take over if the original choice is 
unable to attend. And if you have no alternative (awl-TUR'-na-
tiv), you have no other choice. 
You see how easy it is to understand the meanings of these 
words once you realize that they all come from the same source. 


And keeping in mind that alter means other, you can quickly un-derstand words like alter ego, altercation, and alteration. 
Ari alteration (awl仁氐RAY'.sban)eis of course a change-.....a making into something other. When you alter (A WI.;'.tar) your plans, you make other plans. 
An altercation (awl'.tar-KAY'-shan) is a verbal dispute. When rou have an altercation with someone, you have a violent disagree-ment, a''fight" with words. And why? Because you have other ideas, plans, or opinions than those of the person on the other side of the argument. Altercation, by the way, is stronger than quarrel or dispute-the sentiment is more heated, the disagreement. is lilcely to be angry or even hot-tempered, there may be recourse, if the disputants are human, to profanity or obscenity. You have altercations, in short, over pretty important issues, and the word implies that you get q让teeexcited. 
Alter ego (AWJ..;'一回． 
EE'-go), which combines alter, other, with ego, I, self, -generally refers to someone with whom you are so close that you both do the same things, think alike, react similarly, and are, in temperament, almost mirror images of each other. Any such friend is your other I, your other self, your alter ego. 

USING THE WORDS 

Can you pronounce the words? 
Digging a little into the derivation of three of our basic words, egoist, egotist, and altruist, has put us in touch with two important Latin roots, ego, I, self, and alter, other, and has made it possible for us to explore, with little difficulty, many other words derived from these roots. Pause now, for a moment, to digest these new acquisitions, and to say them aloud.

SESSION 3 
ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.edepends how you turne
Jntrove,;t, extrovert, and ambivert are built on the Latin verbeverto, to turn. If your thoughts are cons.ntly turned inward (intro-), you 
are an introvert; outward (extro-), an extrovert,· and in both directions (ambi-), an ambivert. The prefix ambi-, both, is also found in ambidextrous (am＇一坛DEKS'-tr;is),eable to use both hands with equal skill. The noun is ambidexterity (am'-b过eks-TAIR＇一:i-tee).e

Dexterous (DEKS'-t今ms)emeans skill/ ul, the noun dexterity (deks-TAIR'－:>-teee) is skill. The ending -ous is a common adjec-tive suffix (famous, dangerous, perilous, etc.); -ity is a common noun suffix (vanity, quality, simpllcity, etc.). 

(Spelling caution: Note that the letter following the t-in am-bidextrous is -r, but that in dexterous the next letter is -e.) Dexter is actually the Latin word for right hand一inethe am-bidextrous person, both hands are right hands, so to speak. 
The right hand is traditionally the more skillful one; it is only within recent decades that we have come to. accept that "lefties" or "southpaws" are just as normal as anyone else—and the tenn left-handed is still used as a synonym of awkward. 
The Latin word for the left hand is sinister. This same word, in English, means threatening, evil, or dangero瓜， aefurther com-mentary on our early suspiciousness of left-handed persons. There may still be some parents who insist on forcing left-handed chil-dren to change (though left-handedness is inherited, and as much an integral part of its possessor as eye color or nose shape), with various unfortunate results to the child-sometimes stuttering or an inability to read with normal skill. 





39 
The French word for the left ha叫isegauche, and, as you would suspect, when we took this word over into English we invested it with an uncomplimentary meaning. Call someone gauche (GOSH) and you imply clumsiness, generally social rather than physical. (We're right back to our age-old misconception that left-handed ?eople areless skillful thanright-handed ones.） A gauche remark is tactless; a gauche offer of sympathy is so bumbling as to be em-barrassing; gaucherie (GO'-sh今ree)eis an awkward, clumsy, tact-less, embarrassing way of saying things or of handling situations. The gauche person is totally without finesse. 
And the French word for the right hand is droit, which we have used in building our English word adroit (a-DROYT'). Needless to say, adroit, like dexterous, means skillful, but especially in the exercise of the mental facilities. Like gauche, adroit, or its noun adroitness, usually is used figuratively. The adroit person is quick-witted, can get out 
of difficult spots cleverly, can handle situations ingeniously. Adroitness is, then, quite the opposite of gaucherie. 
2.elove, hate, and marriage
Misanthrope, miso盯nist,eand misogamist are built on the Greekeroot misein, to hate. The misanthrope hates mankind (Greek an-thropos, mankind); the miso盯nistehates women (Greek盯ne,ewoman); the misogamist hates. marriage (Greek gamos, mar一eriage). 
Anthropos, mankind, is also found in anthropology (an-thra-POL'一咋jee),ethe study of the development of the human race; and in philanthropist (￡今LAN'一中rn-pist),e
one who loves man-kind and shows such love by making substantial financial contri-butions to charitable organizations or by donating time and energy 
to helping those in need. 
The root gyne,\1）man, is also found in gynecologist I;if今
KJL'千isteor jin--KOL'－a-jist), the medical specialis ho 
treats female disorders. And the root gamos, marriage, occurs also 
in monogamy (m今NOG勺－mee),ebigamy (BIG'-a-mee), and 
polygamy（产LIG'心mee).e
(As we will discover later, monos means one, bi-means two, 
polys means many.) 







So monogamy is the custom of only one marriage (at a time). 

Bigamy, by etymology, is two marriages一inoactuality, the un-lawful act of contracting another marriage without divorcing one's 
current legal spouse. 
Anod polygamy, by derivation many marriages, and therefore ety-
mologically denotinog plural marriage for either males or females, in current usage generally refers to the custom practiced in earlier times by the Mormons, and before them by King Solomon, in whjch the man has as many wives as he can afford financially and/or emotionally. The correct, but rarely used, term for t_his custom is polygyny (pa,LIJ'-:i-nee)—polys, many, plus gyne, woman. 
What if a woman has two or more husbands, a form of mar-riage practiced in the Himalaya Mountains of Tibet? That custom is called polyandry (pol-ee-AN'-dree), from polys plus Greek andros, male. 

3.omaking friends with suffixeso
English words have various forms, using certain suffixes foronouns referring to persons, other suffixes for practices, attitudes, philosophies, etc, and still others for adjectives. 
Consider: 


Practice, etc. AdjectivePerson 
misanthropy misanthropic misogyny misogynous ot 


2.omisogynisto

misogynistic  
3. gynecologisto4. monogamisto gynecology monogamy  gynecological monogamo邱o 
5.obigamisto bigamy  bigamous  
6. polygamist 7. polygynisto8. polyandristo polygamy polygyny polyandry  polygamous polygynous polyandrous  
9.ophilanthropist 10.oanthropologist  philanthropy anthropologyo philanthropic anthropological  

You will note, then, that -ist is a common suffix for a person; -Y for a practice, attitude, etc.; and -ic or -ous for an adjective. 

41 

4.oliving alone and liking ito
Ascetic is from the Greek word asketes, monk or hermit.oA monk Jives a lonely life一notofor him the pleasures of the 
fleshpots, the laughter and merriment of convivial gatherings, the dissipation of high Jiving. Rather, days of contemplation, study, and rough toil, nights on a hard bed in a simple cell, and the kind of self-denial that leads to a purification of the soul. 

That person is an ascetic who leads an existence, voluntarily of course, that compares in austerity, simplicity, and rigorous hard-ship with the life of a monk. 
The practice is asceticism (a-SET勺－siz-am),othe adjective as一 cetic.

(Answers in Chapter 18.) 


STICK TO YOUR TIME SCHEDULE! 
In three sessions, you have become acquainted with scores of new, vital, exciting words. You understand the ideas behind these words, their various forms and spellings, their pronunciation, their derivation, how they can be used, and exactly what they mean. I do not wish to press a'point unduly, but it is possible that you have learned. more new words in the short time it took you to cover this chapter than the average adult learns in an entire year. This realization should make you feel both gratified and excited. 
Funny thing about time. Aside from the fact that we all, rich or poor, sick or well, have the same amount of time, exactly twenty-four hours every day (that is looking at time from a static point of view),it is also true that we can always find time for the things we enjoy doing, almost never for the things we find unpleasant (and that is looking at time from the dynamic point of view). I am not merely being philosophical一Itam sure you will agree with this concept if you give it a little thought. 
If you have enjoyed learning new words, accepting new chal-lenges, gaining new understanding; and discovering· the thrill of successful accomplishment, then make sure to stay with the time schedule you have set up for yourself. 
A crucial factor in succe对ul,tongoini learning is routine. Develop a comfortable time routine, persevere against all dis-tractions, and you will learn anything you sincerely want to learn. So, to give yourself an edge, write here the day and hour you plan to return to your work:

You have heard the classic riddle: "What is the best use for pigskin?" Answer: "To keep the pig together." Human skin has a similar purpose: it is, if we get down to fundamentals, what keeps us all in one piece. And our outer covering, like 
so many of our internal organs, is subject to diseases and infections of various kinds, running the gamut from simple.acne and eczemas through impetigo, psoriasis, and cancer. There is a specialist who treats all such skin diseases.

USING THE WORDS 

Can you pronounce the words? 

Words take on a new color if you hear them in your own voice; they begin to belong to you more pe飞onally,omore intimately, than if you merely hear or read them. As always, therefore, say the words aloud to take the first, crucial step toward complete mastery.

Do not confuse the internist with the intern (also spelled in-terne), who is a medical graduate serving an apprenticeship inside a hospital. 

2.edoctors for womene
The word gynecologist is built on Greek gyne, woman, pluselogos, science; etymologically, gynecology is the science (in ·actual 
use, the medical science) of women. Adjective: gynecological (gin [or jin or 
Obstetrician derives from Latin obstetr.江，midwife,ewhi.h in tum has its source in a Latin verb meaning to stand—midwives stand in front of the woman in labor to aid in the delivery of the infant. 
The suffix -ician, as in obstetrician, physician, m西cian,magi一ecian, electrician, etc., means exp,;rt. 
Obstetrics (ob-8TET'-riks) has only within the last 150 years become a respectable specialty. No further back than 1834, Pro-fessor William P. Dewees assumed the血techair of obstetrics at the University of Pennsylvania and had to brave considerable medical contempt and ridicule as a result-the delivery of chil-dren was then considered benea由theedignity of the medical pro-fession. 


Adjective: obstetric (ob-STET'-rik) or obstetrical (ob-STET'-ra-kal). 

3.echildrene

Pediatrician is a combination of Greek paidos, child; iatreia,emedical healing; and -ician, expert. Pediatrics (pee-dee-AT'-riks), then, is by etymology the medi-cal healing 
of a child. Adjective: pediatric (p
ee-dee-AT'-
rik). 
(The ped-you see in words like pedestal, pedal, and 
is. from the Latin pedi比，foot,eand despite the identical spelling in 
F巩加hehas no relationship to Greek paidose.)

Pedagogy (PED-a-的'-jee),owhich combines paidos with agogos，妇oding,ois, etymologically,加leadingoof children. And to what do you lead them? To learning, to development, to growth, to maturity. From the moment of birth, infants are led by adults--they are taught, first by parents and then by teachers, to be se止osufficient, to fit into the culture in which they are born. Hence, pedagogy, which by derivation means the leading of a child, refers actually to the principles and methods of teaching. College stu-dents majoring in education take certain standard pedago窃ocourses--the history of education; educational psychology; the psychology of adolescents; principles of teaching; etc. 
Adjective: pedagogical (ped今．GOJ'心kal).o
A pedagogue (PmY今gog)ois versed in pedagogy. But peda-gogue has an unhap
py history. From its original, neutral meaning of teacher, it has deteriorated to the point where it refers, today, to a narrow-minded, strait-laced, old-fashioned, dogmatic teacher. It is a word of contempt and should be used with caution. 
Like. pedagogue. demagogue (DEM宅gog)ohas also deterio-rated in meaning. By derivation 
a leader (agogos) of the people (d.mos), a demagogue. today is actually one who attempts, in es-sence, to mislead the people, a poUtician who foments 
discontent among the masses, rousing them to fever pitch by wild oratory, in an attempt to be voted into office. 
Once elected, demagogues use political power to fur出erotheir own personal ambitions or fortunes. 
Many "leaders" of the past and present, in countries around the world, have been accused of demagoguery (dem-a-OOG'-a-ree). Adjective: demagogic (dem今GOJ'-ik).o







The dermatologist; whose specialty is dermatology (dur-mo-TOL'七jee),ois so named from Greek derma, skin. Adjective: dermatological (dur'-mo-to-LOJ'今比I)．o

See the syilables derma in any English word and you will know there is some reference to skin-for example, a hypodermic · (hI-' po-DUR''"mik) needle penetrates under (Greek, hypos) the skin，· the epidermis (e产DUR'-mis)· is the outermost layer of skin; a taxidermist (TA邸'+dur-mist),owhose business is taxidermy 

61 





(TAKS'-:i-dur-mee), prepares, stuffs, and mounts the sk加ofeanimals; a pac切derme(PAK'-:只mrm)eis an animal with an un-usually thick skin, like an elephant, hippopotamus, or rhinoceros; and dermatitis (dur心氐．Ti'-tis)eis the general name for any skin inflammation, irritation, or infection. 
5.ethe eyes have it
Ophthalmologist一noteethe ph preceding th-is from Greekeophthalmos, eye, plus · logos, science or study. The specialty is ophthalmolo盯(off'-thal-MOL'七jee),ethe adjective ophthal-mological (o肥thal丑1a-LOJ'七kal).e

An earlier title for this physician, still occasionally used, is ocu-list (OK'-y今list),efrom Latin ocul匹， eye,ea root on which the fol-lowing English words are also built: 

1.eocular (OK勺心far)-anadjectiveethat refers to the eyee
2.
monocle(MON'-:吐4)-aelensefor one (monos) eye, sportedeby characters in old movies as a symbol of the British so-called upper class 

3.ebinoculars (b今NOK'-y仑lal'Z）一fieldeglasses that increaseethe range of two 
4.eAnd, strangely enough, inoculate (in-OK勺心layt'),ea wordecommonly misspelled with two n's. When you are inoculated against a disease, an "eye," puncture, or bole is made in your skin, through which serum is injected. 


Do not confuse the ophthalmologist or oculist, a medical spe-cialist, with two other practitioners who deal with the eye-the optometrist (op-TOM'今trist)eand optician (op-TISH'-an). 
Optometr垃seare not physicians, and do not perform surgery or 叫ministeredrugs; they measure vision, test for glaucoma, and prescri飞eeand fit 
Opticians fill an optometrist's or ophthalmologist's prescription, grinding lenses according to specifications; they do not examine patients.

SESSION 6 



1.ethe straightenerse

The orthopedist· is so called from the Greek roots orthos,estraight or correct, and paidos, child. The orthopedist, by etymol-ogy, straightens children. The term was coined in 1741 by the au-thor of a textbook on the prevention of childhood diseases--at that time the correction of spinal curvature in children was a main concern of practitioners of orthopedics (awr-th今PBE'-diks).e




Today the specialty treats deformities, injuries, and diseases of the bones and joints (of adults as well as children, of course), often by surgical procedures. 
Adjective: orthopedic (awr-th千PEE'-dik).
Orthodontia (a叨·-th千DON'-sh:J),ethe straightening of teeth, is built on orthos plus odontos, tooth. The orthodontist (awr--th于 DON'-tist) specializes in improving your "bite," retracting "buck teeth," and by means of braces and other techniques seeing to it that every molar, incisor, bicuspid, etc. is exactly where it belongsin your mouth. 

Adjective: orthodontic (awr-th今DON'-tik).e

2.ethe hearte
Cardiologist combines Greek kardia, heart, and logos, science.The specialty is cardiology (kahr-dee-0L'七jee),ethe adjectivecardiological (kahr'-dee仑．LOJ'今kal).

So a cardi匹 (KAHR'-dee-ak)econdition refers to some mal-functioning of the heart; a cardiogram (KAHR＇一dee-:i-gram')eis an electrically produced record of the heartbeat. The instrument that produces this record is called a cardiograph (KAHR'-dee..g.. graf'). 
3. · the nervous systeme
Neurologist derives from Greek neuron, nerve, plus logos, sci-ence. Specialty: neurology (noor-OL仁a-jee);eadjective: neurological (noor-今LOJ'七bl).Neuralgia (noor-AL'-ja) is acute pain along the nerves and their branches; the word comes from neuron plus algos, pain. 
Neuritis (noor-1'-tis), is inflammation of the nerves. 
Neuro志(nOOr3,-sis)，combiningeneuron with呻，aesuffix meaning abnormal or diseased condition, is not, despite its ety-mology, a disorder of the nerves, but rather, as· descnl>ed by the late Eric Berne, a psychiatrist, "..．血illnessecharacterized byexcessive use of energy for unproductive purposes so that person-ality development is hindered or stopped. A man who spends most 



of his time worrying about his health, counting his money, plotting revenge, washing his · hands, can hope for little emotional growth."e. or Neurotic (n的r-OT'-ik)eis both the adjective form and the term for a person suffering from neurosis. 
4.ethe minde
A neurosis is not a form of mental unbalance. A full-blownemental disorder is called a psychosis (si-KO'-sis), a word built on Greekp．守che,espirit, soul, or mind, plus -osis. 
A true p.rychotic (si-KOT'-ik) has lost contact with reality—at least with reality as most of us perceive it, though no doubt psy-chotic (note that this word, h1ce neurotic, is both a noun and an adjective) people have their own form of reality. 
Built on psyche pl1:15 iatreia, medical healing, a psychiatrist by etymology is a mind-healer. The specialty is psychiatry (s了－oresa-Ki-a-tree); the adjective is psychiatric (si.kee-AT勺ik).e
and geriatrics 
Pediatrics, as you know, is also built on iatreia, as is podiatry (pa-Di'－今tree),discussed, in the next chapter, (jair'-ee-AT'-riks), the specialty dealing with the particular rnedi-cal needs of the elderly. (This word combines iatreia with. Greek 
ge.ras, old age.) The specialist is a geriatrician (jair'-ee心－TRISH'-an),ethe ad-jective is geriatric (jair'-ee-AT'-rik). REVIEW OF ETY从OLOGY

TWO KEYS TO SUCCESS: SELF-DISCIPLINE AND PERSISTENCE 
You can achieve a superior vocabulary in a phenomenally short time—given self-discipline and persistence. 
The greatest aid in building self-discipline is, as I have said, a matter of devising a practical and comfortable sch.dule for your-self and then keeping to that schedule. 


Make sure to complete at least one session each time you pick up the book, and always decide exactly when you will continue with your work before you put the book down. 

There may be periods of difficulty-thenJs the titne to 
exert the greatest self-discipline, the most determined persistence. 
For every page that you study will help you attain a mastery over words; every day that you work will add to your skill in un-derstanding and.using words.

RANDOM NOTES ON MODERN USAGE 


English grammar is confusing enough as it is—what makes it dou-bly confounding is that it is slowly but continually·changing. 

This means that some of the strict'rules you memorized so pain-fully in your high school or college English courses may no longer be completely valid. 
Following such outmoded principles, you may think you are speaking "perfect" English, and instead you may sound stuffy and pedantic. 
The problem boils down to this: If grammatical usage is gradu-ally becoming more liberal, where does educated, unaffected, in-formal speech end? And where does illiterate, ungrammatical speech begin? 
The following notes on current trends in modem usage are in-tended to help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word or words. Does the usage square with your own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your thought in just terms? Decide whether the sentence is right or wrong, then compare your conclusion with the opinion given in the explanatory paragraphs that follow the test.

1. If you drink too many vodka martinis, you will surely getesick. 

RIGHT. The puristic objection is that get has only one mean-ing—namely, obtain. However, as any modem dictionary will at-test, get has 
scores of different meanings, one of the most respecta-hie of which is become.. You can get tired, get di巧，getedrunk, or get sick-and your choice of words will o狂endeno one but a pedant. 





77 


2.eHave you got a dollar?e
RIGHT. If purists get a little pale at the sound of "get sick,''ethey turn chalk white when they hear have got as a substitute for 加ve.eBut the fact is that have got is an established American form of expression. Jacques Barzun, noted author叩deliterary critic, says: "Have you got is good idiomatic English一Ieuse it in speech without thinking about it and would write it if colloqui-alism seemed appropriate to the passage." 
3.eNo ones loves you except I.e
WRONG. In educated speech, me follows the preposition ex-cept. This problem is troublesome because, to the unsophisticated, the sentence sounds 
as if it can be completed to "No one loves you, except/ do," but current educated usage adheres to the tech-nical rule that a preposition requires an objective pronoun (me). 
4.Please切down.e

WRONG. Liberal as grammar has become, there is still noesanction for using lay with the meaning of recline. Lay means to place, as in "L叮yourehand on mine." Lie is the correct choice. 
5.eWho do you love?e
RIGHT. "The English I血guageeshows some disposition to geterid of whom altogether, and unqul'stionably it would be a better language with whom gone." So wrote Janet Rankin Aiken, of Co-lumbia University, way back in 1936. Today, many decades later, the "disposition" bas become a full-fledged force. 
The rules for who and whom are complicated, and few edu-cated speakers have the time, patience, or expertise to bother with them. Use the democratic who in your everyday speech whenever 
it sounds right. 
6.eNeither of these cars are worth the money.e
WRONG. The temptation to use are in this sentence is, I admit,epractically irresistible. However, "neither or'means "neither one or'and is, therefore, is the preferable verb. 
7.eThe judge sentenced the murderer to be hung.e
WRONG. A distinction is made, in educated speech, bet\\'.eenhung and hant必Aepicture is hung, but a person is hanged-th
社 is, if such action is intended to bring about an untimely.demise. 
8.eMother乒neI go out to play?e






RIGHT. If you insist that your child say may, and nothing but may; when asking for permission, you may be considered puristic. Can is not discourteous, incorrect, or vulgar-and the newest edi-tions of the authoritative dictionaries fully sanction the 
use of can in requesting rights, privileges, or permission. 
9. Take two spoo呵uleof this medicine every three hours.e
WRONG. There is a strange affection, on the part of some peo-pie, for spoonsful and cupsful, even though spoo心fuleand cupsful do not exist as acceptable words. The plurals are spoonfuls and cupfuls. 

I am taking for granted, of course, that you are using one spoon and filling it twice. If, for secret reasons of your own, you prefer to take your medicine in two separate spoons, you may then prop-erly speak of "two spoons full (not spoonsful) of medicine." 
10. Your words seem to infer that Jack is a liar.e

WRONG. Infer does not mean hint or suggest. Imply is theeproper word; to infer is to draw a conclusion from another's words. 
11.eI will be happy to go to the concert with you.e
RIGHT. In informal speech, you need no longer worry aboutethe technical and unrealistic distinctions between shall and will. The theory of modern grammarians is that shall-will differences were simply invented out of whole cloth by the textbook writers of the 1800s. As the editor of the scholarly Modern Language Forum at the University of California has stated, "The artificial distinction between shall and will to designate futurity is a super-stition that has neither a basis in historical grammar nor the sound sanction of universal usage." 
12. It is me. 
RIGHT. This "violation" of grammatical "law" has been com-pletely sanctioned by current usage. When the late Winston Churchill made a nationwide radio address from New Haven, Connecticut, many, many years ago, his opening sentence was: "This is me, Winston Churchill." I imagine that the purists who were listening fell into a deep state of shock at these words, but of i:purse Churchill was simply using the kind of down-to.earth Eng-Iish that had long since become standard in informal educated speech. 




79 




13.eGo slow.e
RIGHT.. "Go slow" is not, and never has been, incorrecteEnglish-every authority concedes that slow is an adverb as well as an adjective. Rex: Stout, well-known writer of mystery novels and creator of -Detective Nero Wolfe, remarked: "Not only do I use and approve of the idiom Go slow, but if I find myself with people who do not, I feave quick." 
14.ePeggy and Karen are alumni of the same high school.e

WRONG. As Peggy and Karen are obviously women, we callethem alumnae (a-LUM'-nee); only male graduates are alumni 


15.eI would like to ask you a question.eRIGHT. In current American usage, would may be used with I,ethough old-fashioned rules demand I should. 
Indeed, in modem speech, should is almost entirely restricted to expressing probability, duty, or responsibility. As in the case of the charitable-looking dowager who was 
approached by a seedy cha1J1cter seeking a handout. 
"Madam," he whined, "I haven't eaten in five days." 
"My good man," the matron answered with great concern, "you 

should force yourself!"

SESSION 7 


An ancient Greek mused about the meaning of life, and philoso-phy was born. The first Roman decided to build a road instead of cutting a path through the jungle, and engineering came into exist-ence. One day in primitive times, a human being lent to another whatever then passed for money and got back his original invest-ment plus a li.ttle more-－妞d.ebanking had star比d.e
Most people叩endepart of every workday at some gainful em-ployment, honest or otherwise, and in so doing often contribute their little mite to the progress of the world. 
We explore in this chapter the ideas behind people's occupa-tions--and the words that translate these ideas into verbal sym .. bols.

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1.ethe mental life


P汀chologisteis upon the as psychi-atrist一psyche,spirit, sobuilt ul, or mind. In same p汀chiaGreek trist,troot he combin-ing form is iatreia, medical healing. In psychologist, the combin-ing form is logos, science or study; a psychologist, by etymology, is one who studies the mind. The field is psychology (si-KOL'七jee),ethe adjective psycho-logical (si勺c:i-LOJ'-a-kal).e
Psyche (SI'-kee) is also an English word in its own right—it designates the mental life, the spiritual or non-physical aspect of one's existence. The adjective psychic (SI'-kik) refers to phe-nomena or qualities that cannot be explained in purely physical terms. People · may be 
called psychic if they seem to possess a sixth sense, a -special gift of mind reading, or any mysterious aptitudes that cannot be accounted for logically. A person's画-turbance is psychic if it is emot.ional or mental, rather than physi-cal. 






Psyche combines with the Greek pathos, suffering or disease, to form psychopathic (si-ka-PATH'-ik), an adjective that describes someone suffering from a severe mental or emotional disorder. The noun is psychopathy (si'-KOP'今thee).*e
The root psyche combines with Greek soma, body, to form psy-chosomatic (si'-ko一S今MAT'-ik),ean adjective that delineates the powerful influence that the mind, especially the unconscious, has on bodily diseases. Thus, a person who fears the consequence of being present at a certain meeting will suddenly develop a bad cold or backache, or even be injured in a traffic accident, so that his appearance at this meeting is made impossible. It's a real cold, it's far from ari imaginary backache, and of course one cannot in any sense doubt the reality of the automobile that injured him. Yet, according to the psychosomatic theory of medicine, his un-conscious made him susceptible to the cold germs, caused the backache, or forced him into the path of the car. 

A psychosomatic disorder actually exists insofar as symptoms are concerned (headache, excessive urination, pains, paralysis, heart palpitations), yet there is no organic cause within the body. The cause is within the psyche, the mind. Dr. Flanders Dunbar, in Mind and Body, gives a clear and exciting account of the in-terrelationship between emotions and diseases. 
Psychoanalysis (si'-ko今NAL'－今sis)erelies on the technique of deeply, exhaustively probing-into the unconscious, a technique de-veloped by Sigmund Freud. In oversimplified terms, the general principle of psychoanalysis is to guide the patient to an awareness of the deep-seated, unconscious causes of anxieties, fears, conflicts, and tension. Once fo皿d,eexposed to the light of day, and thoroughly understood, claim the psychoanalysts, these causes may vanish like a light snow that is exposed to strong sunlighte
_Consider an example: You have asthma, let us say, and your

A psychopath {SI仁ko-path'),esometimes called a psycho-patlilc personality, appears to be lacking an inner moral censor, and of血ecommits criminal acts, without anxiety or guilt, in order to obtain im-m础ateegratification of desires. Such a person may be utterly Jacking in sexual restraint, or addicted to hard dru区Someepsychologists prefer the label sociopath {SO'-she妇'-path'oreSO'-see-11-path') for this type of per-sonality to indicate the absence of a social conscien也

doctor can find no physical basis for your ailment. So you are re-ferred to a psychoanalyst (or psychiatrist or clinical psychologist who practices psychoanalytically oriented therapy). 
With your therapist you explore your past life, dig into your un-conscious, and discover, let us say for th. sake of argument, that your mother or father always used to set for you impossibly high goals. No matter what you accomplished in school, it was 
not good enough一inoyour mother.s or father's opinion (and such opinions 
were always made painfully clear to you), you could do better if you were not so lazy. As a child you built up certain re-sentments and anxieties because you seemed unable to please your parent—and (this will sound farfetched, but it is perfectly possi-ble) as a result you became asthmatic. How else were you going to get the parental love, the approbation, the attention you needed and that you felt you were not receiving? 

In your sessions with your therapist, you discover that your asthma is emotionally, rather than organically, based—your ail-ment is psychogenic (si'-ko-JEN'-ik), of psychic origin, or (the terms are used more or Jess interchangeably although they differ somewhat in definition) psychosomatic, resulting from the interac-tion of mind and body. (Psychogenic is built on psyche plus Greek genesis, birth or origin.) 
And your treatment? No drugs, no surgery一theseomay help the body, not the emotions. Instead, you "work out" (this is the term used in psyc加analytico[si-ko-an'今LIT'-ik]oparlance) early trauma in talk, in remembering, in exploring, in inte叩reting,oin reliving childhood experiences. And if your asthma is indeed psychogenic (or psychosomatic), therapy will very likely help you; your attacks may cease, either gradually or suddenly. 
Freudian therapy is less popular today than formerly; many newer therapies-Gestalt, bioenergetics, transactional analysis, 
to name only a few-claim to produce quicker results. 
In any case, psychotherapy (si-ko-THAIR＇一a-pee)_oof one sort or another is the indicated treatment for psychogenic (or psycho-somatic) disorders, or for any personality disturbances. The prac-titioner is a psychotherapist (si-ko-THAIR'-a-pist) or therapist, for short; the adjective is psychotherapeutic (si-ko-thair'-a.. PYOO＇一tik).

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1. the whole toothe
Orthodontist, we discovered in Chapter 4, is built oneorthos, straight, coras rect, plus odontos, tooth. A pedodontist (pee'-do-DON'-tist) specializes in the care of 
children's teeth-the title is constructed from paidos, child, plus odontos. The specialty: pedodontia (pee'-do-DON'-sha); the ad-jective: pedodontic (pee'-d6-DON'一tik).e
A periodontist (pair'-e心－DON'-tist)eis a gum specialist--=-the term combines odontos with the prefix peri-, around, surrounding. (As a q让ckeglance in the mirror will tell you, the gums surround the teeth, more or less.) 
Can you figure out the word for · the specialty? 
For the adjective? 
An endodontist (en'-do-DON'-tist) specializes in work on the pulp of the tooth and in root-canal therapy-the prefix in this term is endo-, from.Greek endon, inner, within.

2.emeasuremente
The optometrist, by etymology, measures vision-the term isebuilt on opsis, optikos, view, vision, plus metron, measurement. 
Metron is the root in many other words: 
1.ethermometer (thgr-MOM吁r)—aneinstrument to meas-ure heat (Greek therme, heat). 
2.
barometer（切ROM'七ter)-aneinstrument to measureeatmospheric pressure (Greek baros, weight); the adjective is bar-ometric (bair'-:i-MET'-rik).

4.emetric system-a decimal system of weights and measures,elong used in other countries and now gradually being adopted in the United States. 
3.ebones, feet, and handse
Osteopath combines Greek osteon, bone, with pathos, suffering,edisease. Osteopathy (os'一tee-OP'-:以bee),eyou will recall, was originalIY. based on the theory that disease is caused by pressure of the bones on blood vessels and nerves. An osteopathic (os'-tee勺 PATH'-ik) physician is not a bone specialist, despite the mislead-ing etymology-and should not be confused with the orthopedist, who is. 


The podiatrist (Greek pous, 11odds, foot, plus iatreia, medical healing) practices podiatry (pa-DI'-今tree).eThe adjective is po-diatric（po'-dee-AT'-rik). 

The root pous, podos is found also in: 
1.eoctopus (OK'－氐pas),ethe eight-armed (or, as the etymol-ogy has it, eight-footed) sea.creature (Greek okto, eight). 
2.eplatypus (PLAT宅pas),ethe strange water mammal with aeduck's bill, webbed feet, and a beaver-like tail that reproduces by laying eggs (Greek platys, broad; flat一hence,eby etymology, a flatfoot!). 
3.epodium (PO'-dee..:am), a speaker's platform, etymologicallyea place for the feet. (The suffix -ium often ·signifies "place where," as in gym匹ium,estadium.“成tor让m,eetc.) 









4. tripod (TRI'-pod), a three-legged (or "footed") stand for a camera or other device (tri一，three).e
5. chiropodist (ka-ROP'丑ist),eearlier title for a podiatrist, and still often used. The specialty is chiropody (ka-ROP'一a-dee).e

Chiropody combines.podos with Greek cheir, hand, spelled chiro-in English words. The term was coined in the· days before labor-saving machinery and push-button devices, when people worked with their hands and developed calluses on their upper ex-tremities as well as on their feet. Today most of us earn a liveli-hood in more sedentary occupations, and so we may develop cal\uses on less visible portions of our anatomy. 
Chiropractors heal with their hands—the specialty is chiro-practic (ki'-ro-PRAK'-tik). Cheir (chiro一），hand,eis the root in chirography (lei-ROG'-r:i-

these days of electronic word-processing),t would be a chirog-
rapher（迂ROG'-ra-far);ethe adjective is chirograp加(kI'-ro-
GRAF'-ik). 
If the suffix -mancy comes from a Greek word meaning fore-telling or prediction, can you decide what chiromancy (KI'-ro-man'-see) must be?

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1. writing and writers 

The Greek verb graphein, to write, is the source of a· great many English words. 
We know that the gravhologist analyzes handwriting, the term combining graphein with logos, science, study. The specialty is graphology (gr吁OL'-:;i-jee),athe adjective· graphological (graf'－今LOJ'心－bl).a
Chirographer is built on graphein plus cheir (chiro-), hand. 



IDEAS 

1. you don't fool even some of the peopleo
Everybody knows your propensity for avoiding facts. You haveobuilt so solid and unsavory a reputation that only a stranger 
is likely to be misled-and then, not for long. 
A notorious liar 
＼ 
2. 
to the.highest summits of artistryo
YoUJi'ability is top-drawer-rarely does anyone lie as convinc-ingly or as artistically as you do. Your skill has, in short, reached the zenith of perfection. Indeed, your mastery of the art is so great that your lying is almost always crowned with success-and you have no trouble seducing an unw叩listenerointo believing 
that you are telling gospel truth. 

A consummate liar 
3. beyond redemption or salvation 

You are impervious to correction. Often as you may be caught in your fabrications, there is no reforming you一youogo right on ly-
ing despite. the punishment, embarrassment, or unhappiness that your distortions of truth may bring upon you. 

An inco汀igibleoliar 

4. too old to learn new trickso

You are the victim of firmly fixed and deep-rooted habits. Tell-ing untruths is as frequent and customary an activity as brushing your teeth in the morning, or having toast and coffee for break-fast, or lighting up a cigarette after dinner (if you are a smoker). And almost as re且exive.o

An inveterate liar 




SESSION 14 

It was the famous Greek philosopher and cynic Diogenes'who went around the streets of Athens, lantern in hand, looking for an honest person. 
This was over two thousand years ago, but I presume that Diogenes would have as little success in his searcq today. Lying seems to be an integral weakness of mortal character一Iodoubt that few human beings would be so brash as to claim that they have never in their lives told at least a partial untruth. Indeed, one philologist goes so far as to theorize that language must have been invented for the sole purpose of deception. Perhaps so. It is cer-tainly true that animals seem somewhat more honest than humans, maybe because they are less gifted mentally. 
Why do people lie? To increase their sense of importance, to es-cape punishment, to gain an end that的uldootherwise be denied them, out of long-standing habit, or sometimes because they actu-ally do not know the differepce between fact and fancy. These are the common reasons for falsification. No doubt there are other, fairly unique, motives that impel people to distort the truth. And, to come right down to it, can we always be certain what is true and what is false? 
If lying is a prevalent and all-too-human phenomenon, there would of course be a number of interesting words to describe di丘erentotypes of liars. 

Let us pretend (not to get personal, but only to help you be-come personally involved in the ideas and words) that you are a liar. 

The question is, what kind of liar are you?

6. Are you going to invite Doris and I to your party? 
WR.ONO. Some people are almost irresistibly drawn to the pro-noun I in constructions like this one. However, not only does such use of I violate a valid and useful grammatical principle, but, more important, it is rarely heard in educated speech. The mean-ing of the sentence is equally clear no matter which form of the pronoun is employed, of course, but the use of 1, the less popular choice, may stigmatize the speaker as uneducated. 
Consider it this way: You would normally say, "Are you going to invite me to your party?" It would be wiser, therefore, to say, 


opinions were unanimous; not a single dissenting voice, out of the twenty-three authors who answere., was raised against the usage. 
0.i1e＂writer responded: "It has been right for about 150 years 

Editors of magazines and newspapers questioned on the same point were just a shade more conservative. Sixty out of sixty-nine accepted the usage. One editor commented: "I think we do not have to be nice about nice any longer. No one can eradicate it from popular speech as a synonym for pleasant, or enjoyable, or kind, or courteous. It is a workhorse of the vocabulary, and prop-erly so." 

The only valid objection to the word is that it is overworked by some people, but this shows a weakness in vocabulary rather than mgrammar. 

压inethe famous story of the editor who said to her secretary: "There are two words I wish you would stop using so much. One is'nice'and the other is'lousy.'" 
"Okay," said the secretary, who was eager to please. "What are they?" 

4. He's pretty sick today.e
RIGHT. One of the purist's pet targets of attack is the wordepretty as used in the sentence under discussion. Yet all modern dictionaries accept such use of pretty, and a survey made by a professor at the University of Wisconsin showed that the usage is established English. 

5. I feel awfully sick. RIGHT. Dictionaries accept this usage in informal speech and 
the University of Wisconsin survey showed that it is established English. 
The great popularity of awfully in educated speech is no doubt due to the strong and unique emphasis that the word gives to an adjectiveesubstitute very, quite, extremely, or severely-and you
— 
considerably weaken the force. 
On the other hand, it is somewhat less than cultivated to say "I feel awful sick," and the wisdom of using awfully to intensify a pleasant concept ("What an awfully pretty child"; "That book.is awfully interesting") is perhaps still debatable, though getting less and less 
so as the years go on. 




usage without qualification. Of twelve dictionary editors, eleven accepted further, and in the case of the authors, thirteen out of twenty-three accepted the word as used. A professor of English at Cornell University 
remarked: "I know of no justification for any present-day distinctj.on between.further and farther''; and a con-suiting editor of the Funk and Wagnalls dictionary said, "There is nothing controversial here. As applied to spatial distance, further and farther have long been interchangeable." 

Perhaps the comment of a noted author and columnist is most to the point: "I like both further and farther, as I have never been able to tell which is which or why one is any farther or further than the other." 
2.eSome people adniit that their principle goal in life is to becomeewealthy.eWRONG. In speech, you can get principal and principle con-fused as often as you like, and will know the difference-both words are pronouncno ed idone entically. ever In writing, however, your spelling will give you away. 
There is a simple memory trick that will help you if you get into trouble with these two words. Rule and principle both end in 
tains an a, and so does main—and principal means main. Getethese points straight and your confusion is over.Heads of schools are called principals, because they are the 
main person in that institution of learning. The money you have in the bank is your principal, your main financial assets. And the stars of a play are principals一theemain actors. 
Thus, "Som. people admit that their principal (main) goal in_ life is to become wealthy," but "Such a principle (rule) is not guaranteed to lead to happiness." 
-le-and a principle is a rule. On the other hand, principal con-
3.eWhat a nice thing to say!e
RIGHT. Purists object to the popular use of五ceeas a synonym for pleasant, agreeable, or delightful. They wish to restrict the word to its older and more erudite meaning of exact or subtle. You will be happy to hear that they aren't getting anywhere. 
When I polled a group of well-known authors on the accept-ability in everyday speech of the popular meaning of nice, their 


145 


rules, but only because they are rarely if. ever used by educated speakers. 
Correctness, in short, is determined by current educated usage. 

The following notes on current trends in modern usage are in-tended to help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word or words. Does the usage square with your own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your thoughts in just such terms? Decide whether the sentence is "right" or "wrong," then compare your conclusions with the opin-

RIGHT. In the nineteenth century, when professional grammari-aris attempted to Latinize English grammar, an artificial distinc-tion was drawn between farther and further, to wit: farther refers to space, further means to a greater extent or additional. Today, as a result, many teachers who are still under the forbidding in-fluence of nineteenth-century restrictions insist that it is incorrect to use one word for the other. 
To check on current attitudes toward this distinction, I sent the test sentence above to a number of dictionary editors, authors, and professors of .nglish, requesting their opinion of the accepta-bility of further in reference to actual distance. Sixty out of eighty-

HOW TO A VOID BEING A PURIST 


Life, as you no doubt realize; is complicated enough these days. Yet puristic textbooks and English teachers with puristic ideas are striving to make it still more· complicated. Their contribution to the complexity of modern living is the repeated claim that many of the natural, carefree, and popular expressions that most of us use every day are "bad English," "incorrect grammar,"''wlgar," or "illiterate." 
In truth, many of the former restrictions and "thou shalt nots" of academic grammar are now outmoded—most educated speak-ers quite simply ignore them. 

Students in my grammar classes at Rio Hondo College are somewhat nonplused when they discover that correctness is not determined by textbook rules and cannot be enforced by school-teacher edict. They invariably ask: "Aren't you going to draw the line somewhere?" 
It is neither necessary nor possible for any one person to "draw the line." That is done--and quite effectively—by the people themselves, by the millions of educated people throughout the na-tion. 
Of course certain expressions may be considered "incorrect" or "illiterate" or "bad grammar''-not because they violate puristic

had an idea--and had to coin a whole new vocabulary to make his idea clear to the world. Those who are familiar with Freud's theories know all the words that explain them一theeunconscious, the ego, the id, the superego, rational切tion,eOedipus complex, and so on. Splitting the atom was once a new idea-anyone famil-iar with it knew something about fission, isotope, radioactive, cyclotron, etc. 
Remember this: your vocabulary indicates the alertness and range·of your m血．Theewords you know show the extent of your understanding of what's going on in the world. The size of your vocabulary varies directly with the degree to which you are grow-ing intellectually. 
You have covered so far in this book several hundred words. Having learned these words, you have begun to think of an equal number of new ideas. A new word is not just another pattern of 
syllables with which to clutter up your mind一aenew word is a new idea to help you think, to help you understand the thoughts of others, to help you expre. your own thoughts, to help you live a richer intellectual life. Realizing these facts, you may become impatient. You will begin to doubt that a book like this can cover all 
the ideas that an alert and intellectually mature adult wishes to be acquainted with. Your doubt is well-founded. One of the chief purposes of this book is to get you started, to give you enough of a push so that you will begin to gather momentum, to stimtilate you enough so that you will want to start gathering your own ideas. Where can you gather them? From good books on new topics. How can you gather them? By reading on a wide range of new subjects. Reference has repeatedly been made to psychology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis in these pages. If your curiosity has been piqued by these references, here is a good place to start. In these fields there is a tremendous and exciting literature-and you can read as widely and as deeply as you wish.

ence, study. Socius is the source of such common words as associ-ate, social, socialize, society, sociable, and antisocial; as well as asocial (ay-SO'-shal), which combines the negative prefix a-with SOCIUS. 

The antisocial person actively dislikes peop比andooften be-haves in ways that are detrimental 
or destructive to society or the social order (anti-, against). 
On the other hand, someone who is asocial is withdrawn and self-centered, avoids contact with others, and feels completely indifferent to the interests or welfare of society. The asocial per-son doesn't want to "get involved."

aphrod坤cs(af-ra-DIZ'-ee-ak'), from Aphrodite, the Greek god-d邸sofslovesand Aphrod坤csis an adjective as well as a noun, but a longer ad-jective form, aphrodis让cal(af-ra-da-宜今bl),sis also used. 

A bibliop出le(BIi斗lee-a-钮）issone who loves books as collecti-bles, admiring their binding, typography,诅ustrations,srarity, etc.-in short, a book collector. The combining root is Greek biblion, book. 
An Anglophile (ANG'-gl今钮）admiressand is fond of the Brit-ish people, customs, culture, etc. The combining root is Latin Anglus, English 

5.swords and how they affect peoples

The semanticist is professionally involved in semantics (sa-MAN'-tiks). The adjective is semantic (s今MAN'.tik)sor seman-tical (SQ-MAN＇一区kal).s


Semantics, lilce orthopedics, pediatrics, and obstetrics, is a sin-gular noun despite the -s ending. Semantics is, not are, an exciting study. However, this rule applies only when we refer to the word as a science or area of study. In the following sentence, semantics is used as a plural:''The semantics of your thinking· are all 
wrong. ＂ 


Two stimulating and highly readable books on the subject, well worth a visit to the li'brary to pick up, are Language in Tho吨htsand Action, by S. I. Hayakawa, and People in Quandaries. by Dr. Wendell Johnson. 


6.show people live 
The profession of the sociologist is sociology (so'-shee-OL'-a-jee or so-s吵OL宅jee).sCan you write, and pronounce, the ad-jective? 
Sociology is built on Latin socius, companion,* plus logos, sci一 

.sCompanion itself has an interesting etymology-Latin com-, with, pluspanis, bread. If you are social, you eujoy breaking bread with companions. Pantry also comes from panis, though far more than bread is stored there. 







More commonly, epitome and the verb epitomi红（今PIT宅m立）areeused in sentences like "She is the epitome of kindness," or''That one act epitomizes her philosophy of life." If you cut ev-erything else away to get to the essential part, that part is a rep-resentative cross-section of the whole. So a woman who is the epit-ome of kindness stands for all people who are kind; and an act that epitomizes a philosophy of life represents, by itseH, the com-plete philosophy. 

3.elove and wordse
Logos, we know, me皿sescience or study,· it may also meaneword or speech, as it does in philology (fa-LOL'-Q-jee), etymo-logically the love of words (from Greek philein, to love, plus logos), or what is more commonly called linguistics (ling-GWIS'-tiles), the science of language, a term derived from Latin lingua, tongue. 


4.emore lovee

Philanthropy (f今LAN'一中rn-pee)eis by etymology the love ofemankind-one who devotes oneself to philanthropy is a philan-thropist（位LAN'一t氐pist),eas we learned in Chapter 3; the ad-jective is philanthropic (fi巨n-THROP'-ik).e

The verb philander (f:i-LAN'一如），eto "play around" sexually, be promiscuous, or have extramarital relations, combines philein with andros, male. (Philandering, despite its derivation, is not of course exclusively the male province. The word is, in fact, derived from the proper name conventionally given to male love飞 in plays and romances of the 1500s and 1600s.) One who engages in the interesting activities catalogued above is a philanderer (f:r LAN勺hr五）．e

By etymology, philosophy is the love of wisdom (Greek sophos, wise); Philadelphia is the City of Brotherly Love (Greek adel-phos, brother); philharmonic is the love of music or harmony (Greek harmonia, harmony); and a philter, a rarely used word, is a love potion. Today we call whatever arouses sexual desire an 
131 



2.emore cutse

The Greek prefix a-makes a root negative; the atom (AT'-:im)ewas so named at a time when it was considered the smallest possi-ble particle of an element, that is, one that could not be cut any further. (We have long since split the atom, of course, with re--suits, as in most technological advances, both good and evil.) The adjective is atomic (:i--TOM'-ik). 

Th. Greek prefix ana-has a number of meanings, one of which is up, as in anatomy（今NAT'-:i--mee),eoriginally the cutting up of a p1ant or animal to determine its structure, later the bodily struc-ture itself. The adjective is anatomical (an'-:i-TOM'-:i--k:il). 
Originally any book that was part of a larger work of many vol-umes was called a tome (TOM)-etymologically, a part cut from the whole. Today, a tome designates, often disparagingly, an ex-ceptionally large book, or one tl1at is heavy and dull in content. 

The Greek prefix dicha-, in two, combines with tome to con-struct dichotO!J'IY (di-KOT'-:i-mee), a splitting in two, a technical word used in astronomy, biolo窃，botany,eand the science of logic. It is also employed as a non-technical term, as when we refer to the dichotomy in the life of a man who is a government clerk all day and a night一schooleteacher after working hours, 
so that his life is, in a sense, split into two parts. The verb is dichotomize (di-KOT'心丑缸）；theeadjective is dichotomous (di-KOT'-:i-m:is). Dichotomous thinking is the sort that divides everything into two parts-good and bad; white and black; Democrats and Republi-cans; etc. An unknown wit has made this classic statement about dichotomous thinking: "There are two kinds of people: those who divide everything into two parts, and those who do not." 
Imagine a book, a complicated or massive report, or some other elaborate document—now figuratively cut on or through it so that you can get to its essence, the very heart of the idea contained in it. What you have is an epitome（今PIT'仑mee),ea condensation of the whole. (From epi-, on, upon, plus tome.) 
An epitome may refer to a summary, condensation, or abridg-ment of language, as in "Let me have an epitome of the book," or "Give me the epitome of his speech."

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1.ecutting in and oute
Flies, bees, beetles, wasps, and other insects are segmentedecreatures—head, thorax, and abdomen. Where these parts join, there appears to the imaginative eye a "cutting in" of the body. 
Hence the branch of zoology dealing with insects is aptly named entomology, from Greek en-, in, plus tome, a cutting. The adjective is entomological (en'－臣m今LOJ勺如I).e
(The word insect m吐esethe same point-it is built on Latin in-in, plus sectus, a form of the verb meaning to cut.) 

The prefix ec-, from Greek ek-, means out. (The Latin prefix, you will recall, is e.立）Combineeec-with tome to derive the words for surgical procedures in which parts are "cut out," or removed: tonsillectomy (the tonsils), appendectomy (the appendix), mas-tectomy (the breast), hysterectomy (the uterus), prostatectomy (the prostate), etc. 

Combine ec-with Greek kentron, center (the Latin root, as we 
have discovered, is centrum), to derive eccentric (gk-SEN＇-trik)一一eout of the center, hence deviating from the normal in behavior, attitudes, etc., or unconventional, odd, strange. The noun is ec-centricity (e巳s:;in-TRIS'仑tee).e

gated for evidence of malignancy. A biopsy is contrasted with an 
autopsy (AW'-top-see), which is medical examination of a 
corpse in order to discover the cause a of death. Th autos in au-
topsy means, as you know, self-in an autopsy, etymologically 
speaking, the surgeon or pathologist determines, by actual view or 
sight 
rather than by theorizing (ie., "by viewing or seeing for

A pendulum swings back and forth, making an audible click at each swing,.and in that way governs or orders the measure (or timing) of the player. Hence it is called a metronome (MET宅nom'),oa word that combines nomos with metron, measurement. 
2.othe earth and its life 

Geologist derives from Greek ge (geo-), earth. The science is geology (jee-OL勺－jee).oCan you write the adjective? (Can you pronounce it?) 
Geometry (jee-0M'-a-tree)—ge plus metron一byoetymology 
"measurement of the earth," is that branch of m11.thematics treat-



such as angles, triangles, squares, spheres, prisms, etc. (The ety-mology of the word shows that this ancient science'was originally concerned with the measurement-of land and spaces on the earth.）、oThe mathematician is a geometrician (je.今ma-TRISH'如），othe adjective is geometric (jee'心MET'-rik).o


Geography (jee-OG'-.fee) is writing about (graphein, to write), or mapping, the earth. A practitioner of the science is a ge-ographer (jee-OG'-.far), the adjective is geographic (jee-牛 GRAF-ik). 
(The name George坛alsooderived from ge (geo-),.earth, plus ergon, work-the first George was an earth-worker or farmer.) Bio/og泣combinesobios, life, with logos, science, study. The sci-ence is biology (bi-OL'-a-jee). The adjective? 

about someone's. life; autobiography (aw'七－bi-OG'-r今fee),othe 
Bios, life, is also found in biography (bi-OG'-ra-fee), writing story of one's life written by oneself; and biopsy (BI'-op-see), a medical examination, or view (opsis, optikos, view, vision), gen-erally through a microscope, of living tissue, frequently performed when cancer is suspected. A small part of the tissue is cut from the affected area and under the microscope its cells can be investi-






ment of stars and other celestial bodies. The science is. astronomy (.i-STRON宅mee),ethe adjective is astronomical (as'-tr.i-NOM'-.i-k.il), a word often used in a non-heavenly sense, as in "the astronomical size of the national debt." Astronomy deals in such enormous distances (the sun, for example, is 93,000,000 miles from the earth, and light from stars travels toward the earth at 186,000 miles per second) that the adjective astronomical is 
applied to any tremendoμsly large figure. 
Astron, star, combines with logos to fonn astrology (::i-STROL'-
衬ee),ewhich assesses the influence of planets and stars on human 
events. The practitioner is an astrologer (::i-STROL'-::i-j忒）．Cane
you form the adjective? (Can 
you pronounce it?) 
By etymology, an avtron血(AS'-tr.i-not')eis a sailor among 
the stars (Greek皿utes,esailor). This person is termed with some-
what less exaggeration a cosmonaut (KOZ'-m今not')by the Rus-
sians (Greek, kosmos, universe). Nautical (NOT'仑k::il),erelating 
to sailors, sailing, ships, or navigation, derives also from nautes, 
and nautes in tum is from Greek naus, ship-a root used in nau-
sea (etymologically, ship-sickness or seasickness!). 
Aster (AS'七r)eis a star shaped flower. Asterisk (AS'-t::i-risk), 
a star-shaped symbol (*), is generally used in writing or printing 
to direct the reader to look for a footnote. Astrophysics (as'呤e
FIZ'-iks) is that branch of physics dealing with heavenly bodies. 
Disaster (d忒ZAS'-t:1r)eand disastrous (d:1-ZAS勺r:is)ealso 
come from astron, star. In ancient times it was believed that the 
stars ruled human destiny; any misfortune or calamity, therefore, 
happened to someone because the stars were in opposition. (Dis-, 
a prefix of many meanings, in this word signifies against.) 

Nomos, arrangement, law, or order, is found in two other in-
teresting English words. 
For example, if you can make your own laws for yourself, if 
you needn't answer to anyone else for what you do, in short, if 
you are independent, then you enjoy autonomy (aw-TON'心 
mee), a word that combines nomos, law, with autos, self. Au-
tonomy, then, is self-law, self-government. The fifty states in our 

nation are fairly autonomous (aw-TO'.N'-:i-m:is), but not com-
pletely so. On the other hand, ·in most colleges each separate de-
partment is pretty much autonomous. And of course, one of the

Science, then, deals with human knowledge--as far as it has gone. It has gone very far indeed since the last century or two, when we stopped basing our thinking on guesses, wishes, theories that had no foundation in reality, and concepts of how the world ought to be; and instead began to explore tlie world as it was, and not only the world but the whole universe. From Galileo, who looked through the first telescope atop a tower in Pisa, Italy, through Pasteur, who watched microbes through a microscope, to Einstein, who deciphered riddles of the universe by means of mathematics, we have at last begun to fill in a few areas of igno-rance.

To bring this report up to the minute, I asked a number of edi-tors about their attitude toward the split infinitive. Here are two typical reactions. 

An editor at Doubleday and Company: "The restriction against the split infinitive. is, to my mind, the most artificial of all gram-matical rules. I find that most educated people split infinitives reg-ularly in their speech, and only eliminate them from their writing when they rewrite and polish their material." 
An editor at Reader's Digest: "I want to defend the split infini-tive. The construction adds to the strength of the sentence--it's compact and clear. This is to loudly say that I split an infinitive whenever I can catch one." 
And here, finally, is the opinion of humorist James Thurber, as quoted by Rudolf Flesch in The Art of Plain Talk: "Word has somehow got around that the split infinitive is always wrong. This is of a piece with the outworn notion· that it is always wrong to strike a lady." 
I think the evidence is conclusive enough—it is perfectly correct to consciously split an infinitive whenever such an act increases the strength or clarity of your sentence. 







may only prescribe and fit glasses. And they are not medical doc-tors. The M.D. who specializes in the treatment of eye diseases, and who may operate when necessary, is an ophthalmologist. (See Chapter 4.) 


7. Do you prophecy another world war?e
WRONG. _Use prophecy only when you mean prediction, a noun.eWhen you mean predict, a verb, as in this sentence, use prophesy. This distinction is simple and foolproof. Therefore we properly say: "His ·prophecy (prediction) turned out to be true," but."He really seems able to prophesy (predict) political trends." There is a distinction also in the pronunciation of these two words. Proph-ecy is pronounced PROF'今see;eprophesy is pronunced PROF'-a-si'. 

8. Leave us not mention it.e
WRONG. On the less sophisticated levels of American speech,eleave is a popular substitute for let. On educated levels, the fol-lowing distinction is carefully observed: let means allow; leave means depart. (There are a few idiomatic exceptions to this rule, but they present no problem.) "Let me go" is preferable to "Leave me go" even on the most informal of occasions, and a sentence like "Leave us not mention it" is not considered standard English. 
9. If you expect to eventually succeed, you must keep trying.e
RIGHT. We have here, in case you're puzzled, an example ofethat notorious bugbear of academic grammar, the "split infinitive." (An infinitive is a verb preceded by to: to succeed, to fail, to 
remember.) Splitting an infinitive is not at all difficult
—you need only insert a word between the to and the verb: to eventually succeed, to completely fail, to quickly remember. 
Now· that you know how to split an infinitive, the important question is, is it legal to do so? I am happy to be able to report to you that it is not only legal, it is also ethical, moral, and some-times more effective than to not split it. Benjamin Franklin, Wash-ington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson, among many others, were unconscionable infinitive splitters. And modem writers are equally partial to the construction. 



yourself in the position 
of being damned if you do and damned if you don't. 

3.eFive and five is ten.e

RIOHT. But don't jump to the conclusion that "five and five areeten" is wrong一botheverbs are equally acceptable in this or any similar construction. If you prefer to think of "five-and-five" as a single mathematical concept, say is. If you find it more reasonable 
to consider "five and five" a plural idea, say are. The teachers I've polled o.nthis point are about evenly divided in preference, and so, I imagine, are the rest of us. Use whichever verb has the greater appeal to your sense of logic. 

4.eI never saw a man get so mad.e
RIGHT. When I questioned a number of authors. and editorseabout their opinion of the acceptability of mad as a synonym for angry, the typicalreaction was: "Yes, I say mad, but I always feel a little guilty when I do." 
Most people do say mad when they are sure there is no English teacher listening; it's a good sharp word, everybody understands exactly what it means, and it's a lot stronger than angry, though not quite as violent as furious or enraged. In short, mad has a spe-cial implication offered by no other word in the English language; as a consequence, educated people use it as the occasion demands and it is perfectly correct. So correct, in fact, that every authori-tative dictionary lists it as a completely acceptable usage. If you feel guilty when you say mad, even though you dori't mean ins(lne, 



5.eEvery one of his sisters are unmarried.e
WRONG. 
Are is perhaps the more logical word, since the sen-tence implies that he has mor. than one sister and they are all un-married. In educated speech, however, the tendency is to. make the verb agree with the subject, even if logic is violated in the process--and the better choice here would be is, agreeing with the singular subject, every one. 

6.eHe visited an optometrist for an eye operation.e
WRONG. If the gentleman in question did indeed need an opera-tion, he went to the wrong doctor. In most states, optometrists are forbidden by Jaw to perform surgery or administer drugs—they 


"Me, please尸e
"No, dear, not me." 
"Oh. I, please?" 

(This sounds terrible to a child's ear. It completely violates his sense of language, but he does want the jelly apple, so he grudg-ingly conforms.) 


"Who broke my best vase?" 
"It wasn't me!" 
"Is that good English, Johnnie?" 
"Okay, it wasn't I. But honest, Mom, it wasn't me--1 didn't 
even touch it!" And so, if the child is strong enough to survive such constant corrections, he decides that whenever there is room for doubt, it is safer to say I. Some adults, conditi9ned in childhood by the kind of misguided censorship detailed here, are likely to believe that "between you and I" is the more elegant form of expression, but most educated speakers, obeying the rule that a preposition governs the objective pronoun, say "between you and me." 


2.eI'm your best friend, ain't I?e
W-RONG. As linguistic-scholars have frequently pointed out, it is unfortunate that ain't I? is unpopular in educated speech, for the phrase fills a long-felt need. Am I not? is too prissy for down如eearth people; amn't I? is ridiculous; and aren't I, though popular in England, has never really caught on in America. With a sen-tence like the one under discussion you are practically in a linguis-tic trap-there is no way out unless you are willing to choose be-tween appearing illiterate, sounding prissy, or feeling ridiculous. 
"What is the matter with ain't I? for am I not?" language scholar Wallace Rice once wrote. "Nothing whatever, save that a number of minor grammarians object to it. Ain't I? has a pleasant sound once the ears are unstopped of prejudice." Mr. Rice has a valid point there,、 yeteeducated people avoid ain't l? as if it were catching. In all honesty, therefore, I must say to you: don't use ain't I?, except humorously. W沺tisea safe substitute? Apparently none exists, so I suggest that you manage, by some linguistic calis-thenics, to avoid having to make a choice. Otherwise you may find

tended to heJp you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word or words. Does the usage square with your own language patterns? Would you be willing to phrase your thoughts in just such terms? Decide whether the sentence is right or wron&, then compare your conclusion with the opinions given following the test.

WRONG. Children. are so frequently corrected by parents and teachers when they say me that they cannot be blamed if they begin to think that this simple syllable is probably a naughty word. Dialogues such as the following are certainly typical of many households. 
"Mother, can me and Johnnie go out and play?" 
"No, dear, not until you say it correctly. You mean'May John-nie and I go out to play?'" 
"Who wants a jelly apple?" 
"Me!" 
"Then use· the proper word." (The child becomes a little confused at this point-there seem to be so many''ptoper''and "improper''words.) 






Brief Intermission Three 
HOW GRAMMAR CHANGES 


If you think that grammar is 
an exact science, get ready for a shock. Grammar is a science, all right-but it is most inexact. There are no inflexible laws, no absolutely hard and fast rules, no unchanging principles. Correctness varies with the times and depends much more on geography, on social class, and on collec-_ tive human caprice than on the restrictions found in textbooks. 
In mathematics, which is an exact science, five and five make ten the country over-in the North, in the South, in the West; in Los Angeles and Coral Gables and New York. There are no two opinions on the matter一weeare dealing, so far as we know, with a universal and indisputable fact. 

In grammar, however, since the facts are highly susceptible to change, we have to keep an eye peeled for trends. What are educated people saying these days? W珈heexpressions are gener-ally used and accepted on educated levels, which others are more or less restricted to the less educated levels of speech? The an-swers to these questions indicate the氐ndeof usage in the United States, and if such trends come in conflict with academic rules, then the rules are no longer of any great importance. 
Grammar follows the speech habits of the majority of educated people-not the other way around. That is the important point to keep in mind. 
The following notes on current trends in modem usage are in-



109 

suddenly and inexplicably become popular among writers? Obvi一eously, that's nonsense. 
The change is in you. You have now begun to be alert to words, you have developed.what is known in psychology as a "mind-set" toward certain words. Therefore, whenever these words occur in your reading you talce special notice of them. 

The same words occurred before--and just as plentifully一butesince they presented little communication to you, you reacted to them with an unseeing eye, with an ungrasping mind. You were figuratively, and almost liter扯y,eblind-to them. 
Do you remember when you bought, or contemplated buying, a new car? Let's say it was a Toyota. Suddenly you began to see Toyotas all around you-you had a Toyota "mind-set."· 

It is thus with anything new in your life. Development of a "mind-set" means that the new experience has become very real, very important, almost vital. 


If you have become suddenly alert to the new words you have been learning, you're well alQng toward your goal of-building a superior vocabulary. You are beginning to live in a new and dif-ferent intellectual atmosphere-nothing less! 
On the other h皿d,eif the phenomenon I have been describing 
has not yet occurred, do not despair. It will. I am alerting you to 
its possibilities--recognize it and welcome it when it happens.

This phenomenon is as follows: You read a magazine article and suddenly you see one or more of the words you have recently learned. Or you open a book and there again are some of the words you have been · working with. In short, all your reading seems to call to your attention the very words you've been study-ing.

Though chirography may be a lost art, calligraphy（k:i-LIG'-ra-fee) is enjoying a revival. For centuries before the advent.of print-ing, calligraphy, or penmanship as an artistic expression, was practiced by monks. 
A calligrapher (ka-LIG'-n过ar)eis called upon to design and write announcements, place cards, etc., as a touch of elegance. The adjective is calligrap加(kal＇心GRAF'-ik).e
Calligraphy combines graphein with Greek kallos,:I: beauty, and so, by etymology, means beautiful writing. If a word exists for artistic handwriting, there m匹tebe one for the opposite--bad, scrawly, or illegible handwriting. And indeed 
there is--cacography (ka-KOG＇-rn-fee), combining graphein 
with Greek kakos, bad, harsh. By analogy with the forms of calligraphy, can you write the word for: One who uses bad or illegible handwriting? 
Pertaining to, or marked by, bad handwriting (adjective)? 
Graphein is found in other English words: 
1.ecardiograph (discussed in Chapter 4)-etymologically ae
"heart writer''(kardia, heart). 

"written by light" (Greek a "sound writer" (Greeke
4.etelegraph-etymologically a "distance writer" (Greek tele-,edistance). 
5.
biography-etymologically "life writin旷(Greek,ebios, life).e


(Many of these new.roots will be discussed in greater detail inelater chapters.) 
2.eaging and the olde
We know that a geriatrician specializes in the medical care ofethe elder.y. The Greek word geras, old· age, has a derived form, 
土 Aneentrancing word that also derives from kallos is callipygian (kal'-oPIJ'-ee-叩），aneadjective describing a shapely or attractive rear end, or a 
person so endowed一出eecombining root is pyge, buttocks.

5.oan early starto
You have such a long history of persistent falsification that oneocan only suspect that your vice started when you were reposing in your mother's womb. In other words, and allowing for a greatdeal of exaggeration for effect, you have been lying from the mo-ment of your birth. 
A congenital liar 


6. no letup

You never.stop lying. While normal people lie on occasion, andooften for special reasons, you lie continually-not occ.asionally or even frequently, but over and over. 
A chronic liar 
7. a strange diseaseo
You are not concerned with the difference between truth andofalsehood; you do not bother to distinguish fact from fantasy. In fact, your lying is a dise_ase that no antibiotic can cure. 
A pathological liar 
8.ono regretso
You are completely without a conscience. No matter whatomisery your fabrications may cause your innocent victims, you never feel the slightest twinge of guilt. Totally unscrupulous, you are a dangerous person to get mixed up with. 
An unconscionable liar 
Possessed of a lively imagination and a ready tongue, you canodistort facts as smoothly and as effortlessly as you can say your name. But you do not always get away with your lies. 







Ironically enough, it is your very smoothness that makes you suspect: your answers are too quick to be true. Even if we can't immediately catch you in your lies, we have learned from unhappy past experience not to. suspend our critical faculties when you are talking. We admire your nimble wit, but we listen with a skeptical 
ear. 

A glib liar 

Lies, after all, are bad-they are frequently injurious to other people, and may have a particularly dangerous effect on you as a liar. At best, if you are caught you suffer some embarrassment. At worst, if you succeed in your deception your character becomes warped and your sense of values suffers. Almost all lies are harm-ful; some are no less than vicious. 
If you are one type of liar, all your lies are vicious-calcu-latedly, predetern血edly,ecoldly, and advisedly vicious. In short, your lies are so outstandingly hurtful that people gasp in amaze-ment and disgust at hearing them. 
An egregious liar 

In this chapter the ten basic words revolve rather closely around a central core. Each one, however, has a distinct, a unique mean-ing, a special implication. Note the differences.

With the exception of consummate and congenital, all ten ad-jectives have strongly derogatory implications and are generally used to describe people, characteristics, or conditions we disap-prove of.

SESSION 15 



1.ewell-knowne
"Widely but unfavorably known" is the common definition forenotorious. Just as. a notorious .liar is well-known for unreliable 
statements, so a notorious gambler, a notorio匹thief,eor a notori-


ous killer has achieved a wide reputation for some form of an-tisocial behavior. The noun is notoriety（动－t今RI仁Q-tee).a
The derivation is from Latin notus, known, from which we also get noted. It is an interesting characteristic of some words that a change of syllables can alter the emotional impact. Thus, an ad-mirer of.certain business executives will speak of them as "noted industrialists"; these same people's enemies will call them "notori-ous exploiters."-Similarly, if we admire a man's or a woman's un-worldliness, we refer to it by the complimentary term childlike; but if we are annoyed by the trait, we describe it, derogatively, as 
childish. Change "-lilce" to "-ish" and our emotional tone under-goes a complete reversal. 



2.aplenty of room at the topa
The top of a mountain is called, as you know, the summit, aaword derived from Latin summus, highest, which also gives us the mathematical term sum, as in addition. A consummate artist has reached the very highest point of perfection; and to consum-mate (KON':.sg-m顽）aamarriage, a business deal, or a contract is, etymologically, to bring it to the highest point; that is, to put the final touches to it, to bring it to completion. 
[Note how differently consummate (kgn-SUM勺t),athe,adjec-tive, is pronounced from the verb to co心ummate(KON'一s:i-mayt')]. 

Nouns are formed from adjectives by the addition of the noun suffix -ness: sweet--SWeetness; simple一-simpleness,·aenvious--en-11iousness; etc.aMany adjectives, however, have alternate noun forms, and the 
adjective consummate is one of them. To make a noun out of con-summate, add either -ne:rs or-a勺；aco心ummatenessa(kon-SUM'-gt-n忑）orconsumma守（bn-SUM'仑see).a


Verbs ending in-ate .variably tack on the noun suffix -ion to form nouns: create--creation；印aluate-evaluation;aetc. Can you write the noun form of the verb to consummate? 
158 


3.eno help 

Call'people incorrigible (in-KA WR'－:i-j:i-b:il) if they do any-thing to excess, and if all efforts to correct or reform them are to no avail. Thus, one can be an incorrigible idealist, an incorr.gible criminal, an incorrigible optimist, 
or an incorrigible philanderer. The word derives from Latin co"igo, to correct or set straight, plus the negative prefix in-. (This prefix, depending on the root it precedes, .ay be negative, may intensify the root, as in invaluable, or may mean in.) 
The noun is incorrigibility(in-kawr'.j:i-BIL＇一:i-tee)eor, alter-natively, incorrigibleness. 




4.eveterans 

Inveterate, from Latin vetus, old,* generally indicates disap-proval. Inveterate gamblers have grown old in the habit, etymologically speaking; inveterate drinkers have been imbibing for so. long that they, too, have formed old, well-established habits; and inveterate liars have 
been lying for so long, and their habi岱areeby now so deep-rooted, that one can scarcely remember (the word implies) when they ever told the truth. The noun is inveteracy (in-VET'-;,r-:i-see) or inveterateness. A veteran(VET勺－r:ine),eas of the Armed Forces, grew older 

servin
g the country; otherwise a veteran is an old 
hand at the 
game (and therefore skillful). The word is both a noun and an adjective: a veteran at (or in) swim血nge,etennis, police work, business, negotiations, diplomacy--or a veteran actor, teacher, diplomat, political reformer. 
*e
Latin sene:r, source of senile and senescent, also, you will recall, -meanseold. In inveterate,加 meansein; it is not the ne职ti四 prefixefound. in incor-
rigible. 






5.obirtho

Gre.k genesis, birth or origin, a root we discovered in discuss-ing psychogenic (Chapter 5), is the source of a great many Eng-Iish words. 


Genetics (j今NET'-ilcs)ois the science that treats of the trans-mission of hereditary characteristics from parents to o红spring.oThe scientist specializing in the field is a geneticist (j.NET宅osist), the adjective is genetic (j今NET'-ik).oThe particle in the chromosome of the germ cell containing a hereditary charac-teristic is a gene (JEEN). 
Genealogy (jeen'-ee-AL今jee)ois the study of family trees or ancestral origins (logos, study). The practitioner is a genealogist (jeen'-ee-AL宅jist).oCan you form the adjective? 
. (And can you pronounce it?) 
The genital (GEN＇仑tal),oor sexual, organs are involved in the 
process of conception and birth. The genesis (JEN＇.Q-Sis) of any-
thing-aplan, idea, thought, career, etc.-is its beginning, birth, or origin, and Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, 
describes the creation, or birth, of the universe. 、 
Congenital is constructed by combining the prefixocon-, with or together, and the root genesis, birth. 
So a congenital defect, deformity, condition, etc. occurs during the nine-month birth process (or period of gestation, to become technical). Hereditary (h千R曰y仑tair'-ee)ocharacteristics, 

the other hand, are acquired at the moment of conception. Thus, on eye color, nose shape, hair texture, and other such qualities are hereditary; they are determined by the genes in the germ ceJis of the mother and father. But a thalidomide baby resulted from the use of the drug by a pregnant woman, s. the deformities were congenital. Congenital is used both literally and figuratively. Literally, the 
word generally refers to some medical deformity or abnormality occurring during gestation. Figuratively, it wildly exaggerates, for effect, the ve可earlyoexistence of some quality: congenital liar, congenital fear of the dark, etc.

SESSION 16 
ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.eof time and placee
A chronic liar lies constantly, again and again and again; aechronic invalid is ill time after time, frequently, repeatedly. The 
d
derivation of the woreis Greek chronos, time. The noun form is chronicity（氐NIS'七tee).eAn anachronism（今NAK'－mniz如）isesomeone or something out of血ee,eout of date, belonging to a different era. either earlier 




or later. (The prefix ， ana-like a-, is negative.) The adjective is 
anachronous(今NAK心血）oreanachronistic（今nak'七NIS'-tik). 

Wander along Fifty-ninth Street and Central Park in Manhattan some Sunday. You will see horse-drawn carriages with top-hatted coachmen-aevestige of the l 800s. Surrounded by twentieth-cen-tury motorcars and modern skyscrapers, these romantic vehicles of a bygone era are anachronous. 
Read a novel in which a scene is supposedly taking place in the nineteenth century and see one of the characters turning on a TV set. An anachronism! 

Your friend talks, thinks, dresses, and acts as if he were living in the time of Shakespeare. Another anachronism! 

Science fiction is deliberately anachronous一itedeals with phe-nomena, gadgetry, accomplishments far off (possibly) in the fu-ture. 
An anachronism is out of time,· something out of place is incon-gruous (in-KONG'-grtm-:is), a word combining the negative prefix in一，theeprefix con-, with or together, and a Latin verb meaning to agree or co"-e'Spond. 

Thus, it is incongruous to wear a sweater and slacks to a formal 
wedding; it is anachronous to wear the wasp waist, conspicuous 
bustle, or powdered wig of the eighteenth century. The noun form 
of incongruous is incongruity (in-k:ing-GR改），心tee).e
Chronological (kron..g..LQJ'，如1),ein.correct time order, comes from chronos. To tell a story chronologically is to relate the events in the time order of their occurrence. Chro叩logye(kr:i-NOL'-:i-jee) is the science of time order and the accurate dating of events (logos, science)一;theeexpert in this field is a chronol
-ogist（氐NOL'-:i-jist)-orea list of events in the time order in which they have occurred or will occur. 
A chronometer（氐NOM'今tar),ecombining chronos with met-ron, measurement, is a highly accurate timepiece, especially one used on ships. Chronometry（氐NOM'心－tree)eis the measure-ment of time--the adjective is chronometric (kron'今MET'-rik).e
Add the prefix syn-, together, plus the verb suffix -ize, to chronos, and you have constructed synchronize (SIN＇士m－n记），eetymologically to time together, or to move, happen, or cause to happen, at the same time or rate. If you and your friend synchro-



血eeyour watches, you set them at the same time. If you synchro-nize the activity of your arms and legs, as in swimming, you mov. them at the time or rate. The adjective is synchronous 
(SIN'-kr:i-n:is); the same noun form of 
the verb synchronize is syn-chroniz.ation (sin'-kr今n:i-ZAY'-sh:in). 

2.edisease, suffering, feeling 
Pathological is diseased (a pathological condition)—this mean-
Pathology (p::i-THOL'－今jee)eis the science or study of disease -its nature, cause, cure, etc. However, another· meaning of theenoun ignores logos, and pathology may be any morbid, diseased,eor abnormal physical condition or conditions; in short, simply dis-ease, as in "This case involves so many kinds of pathology thateseveral different specialists are working on it." 
A pathologist（产THOL'七jist)eis an expert who examines tis-sue, often by autopsy or biopsy, to diagnose disease and interpret the abnormalities in such tissue that may be caused by specific dis-eases. 
Pathos occurs in some English words with the additional mean-ing of feeling. If you feel or suffer with someone, you are sympa-thetic (sim-p今THET'-ik)-sym-is a respelling before the letter p of the Greek prefix syn-, with or together. The noun is sympathy (SIM'一产thee),ethe verb sympathize (SIM'-p::i-thTz). Husbands, for example, so the story goes, may have sympathetic labor pains when their wives are about to deliver. 
The prefix anti-, you will recall, means against. If you experi-ence antipathy (an-TIP'-::i-thee) to people or things, you feel against them—you feel strong dislike or hostility. The adjective is antipathetic (an'－氐p::i-THET'-ik),eas in "an antipathetic reac-ing of the word ignores the root logos, science, study. 
tion to an authority figure." But you may have no feeling at all
—just indifference, lack of any interest, emotion, or response, complete listlessness, especially when some reaction is normal or expected. Then you are apathetic (ap-::i-THET'-ik); a-, as you know, is a negative prefix. The noun is apathy (AP'今thee),eas in voter apathy, student apathy, etc. 






On the otbex: band, you may be so sensitive or perceptive that you not only share the feelings of another, but you also identify with those feelings, in fact experience them yourself as if momen-tarily you were that other person. What you have, then, is em-pathy (EM'一产thee); you empath比ee(EM'-pa-tbiz'), you are empathetic (em-pa-TIIET'-ik), or, to use an alternate adjective, empathic (em-PATH'-ik). Em-is a respelling before the letter p of the Greek prefix en-, in. 
Someone is pathetic（产TIIET'-ik)ewho is obviously suffering -Such a person may arouse sympathy or pity (or perhaps an-tipathy?) in you. A pathetic story is about suffering and, again, is likely to arouse sadness, sorrow, or pity.e. 
Some interesting research was done many years ago by Dr. J.B. Rhine and bis associates at Duke University on extrasensory per-ception; you will find an interesting account of Rhine's work in his book The Reach of the Mind. What makes it possible for two peo-ple separated by miles of space to communicate with each other without recourse to messenger, telephone, telegraph, or postal service? It can be done, say the believers in telepathy（ta-LEP勺-thee), also called mental telepathy. though they do not yet admit to knowing how. How 
can one person read the mind of another? Simple--by being telepathic (tel－今PATH'-ik),ebut no -one can explain the chemistry or biology of it. Telepathy is built by com-bining pathos, feeling, with the prefix tele-, distance, the same prefix we found in telephone, telegraph, telescope. 
Telepathic (tel-a-PATIi＇一ik)ecommunication occurs when peo-pie can feel each other's thoughts from a distance, when they have ESP.

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.oknowingo

Psychopaths commit antisocial and unco瓜cionableoacts-,-theyoare not troubled by conscience, guilt, remorse, etc. over what they have done. 
Unco瓜cionableoand co心cienceoare related in derivation一－theofirst word from Latin scio, to know, the second from Latin scie巫oknowing, and both using the prefix con-, with, together. 

Etymologically, then, your conscience is your knowled驴withoa moral sense of right and wrong; if you are皿conscionable,oyour conscience is not (un-) working, or you have no conscience. The 


noun form is unconscionableness or unconscionability (un-kon'-sha-na-BIL＇今tee).oConscious, also from con-plus scio, is knowledge or awareness of one's emotions or sensations, or of what's happening around 
·'o
one. Sci印ce,ofrom sciens, is systematized knowledge as opposed, for example; to belief, faith, intuition, or guesswork. 
Add .atin omnis, all, to sciens, to construct omniscient (om-NISH勺nt),oall-knowing, possessed of infinite knowledge. The noun is omniscience (om-NISH勺ns).o
Add the prefix pre-, before, to sciens, to construct prescient (PREE'-shant)—knowing about events before they occur, i.e., psychic, or possessed of unusual powers of prediction. The noun is prescience (PREE'-shans). 

And, 
finally, add the negative prefix ne-to sciens to produce nescient (NESH'-:int), not knowing, or ignorant. Can you, by analogy with the previous two words, write the noun form of nes-cient?o. ((Can you pronounce it?) 





2.ofool some of the people...o


Glib is from an old English root that means slippery. Glib liarsoor glib talkers are smooth and slippery;_they have ready answers, fluent tongues, a pe皿asiveoair..,....but, 
such is the implication of the word, they fool only the most 
nescient, for their smoothness lacks血cerityoand conviction. 
The noun is glibness. 

3.oherds and flockso
Egregious (remember the pronunciation?今GR邸＇一jas)ois fromoLatin grex, gregis, herd or flock. An egregious lie, act, crime, mis-take, etc. is so exceptionally vicious that it conspicuously 
stands out (e-, a shortened form of the prefix ex-, out) from the herd or 彻ckoof other bad things. 

The noun is egregiousness(今GREE＇一jas-n忑）．oA person who enjoys companionship, who, etymologically, likes to be with the herd, who reaches out for friends and is happiest 


173 


when surrounded by people--such a person is gregarious (gr千 GAIR'-ee-as). Extroverts are of course gregarious-they prefer human con-tact, conversation, laughter, interrelationships, to solitude. The suffix -ness, as you know, can be added to an adjective to construct a noun form. Write the noun for gregarious: 
Add the prefix con-, with, together, to grex, gregis, to get the verb congregate (KONG'-gra-gayt'); add the prefix se-, apart, to build the verb segregate (SEG'-rg..gayt'); add the prefix ad-, to, toward (ad-changes to ag-before a root starting with g一），toecon-struct the verb aggregate (AG-ra-gayt'). 
Let's see what we have. When people gather together in a herd or flock, they (write the verb) The noun is congregation (con(-gr今GAY'-shan),eone of the meanings of which is a religious节ock."e
Put people or things apart from the herd, and you (write the verb) them. Can you construct the noun by adding the suitable noun suffix? 
Bring individual items to or toward the herd or flock; and you (write the verb) them. What is the noun form of this verb? 
The verb aggregate also means to come together to or toward the herd, that is, to gather into a mass or whole, or by extension, to total or amount to. So aggregate, another noun form, pro-nounced AG'-n冯忒，iesea group or mass of individuals considered as a whole, a herd, or a flock, as in the phrase''people in the

(Answers in Chapter 18) 



FOUR LASTING BENEFITS 

You know by now that it is easy to build your vocabulary if you work diligently and intelligently. Diligence is important一toocome to the book occasionally is to learn new words and ideas in an 



aimless fashion, rather than in the continuous way that charac-terizes the natural, uninterrupted, intellectual growth of a child. (You will recall that children are top experts in increasing their vocabulari邸）Andean intelligent.approach is crucial一newewords can be completely understood and permanently remembered only as symbols of vital ideas, never if memorized in long lists of iso-lated forms. 
If you have worked diligently and intelligently, you have done much more than merely learned a few hundred new words. Actu-ally, I needn't tell you what else you've accomplished, since, if you really have accomplished it, you can feel it for yourself; but it may be useful if I verbalize the feelings you may have. 

In addition to learning the meanings, pronunciation, back-ground, and use of 300-350 valuable words, you have: 
1.eBegun to sense a change in your intellectual atmosphere.e(You have begun to do your thinking with many of the words, with many of the ideas behind the words. You have begun to use the words in your speech and writing, and have become alert to their appearance in your reading.) 
2.eBegun to develop a new interest in words as expressions ofeidear. 
3. Begun to be aware of the new words you hear and that youesee in your reading. 
4.eBegun to gain a new feeling for the relationship betweenewords. (For you realize that-many words are built on roots from other languages and are related to other words which derive from the same roots.) 





Now, suppose we pause to see how successful your learning has been. In the next chapter, I offer you a comprehensive test on the first part of your work.

SESSION 19 

Verbs are incalculably useful to you. 

Every sentence you· think, say, read, or write contains an im-plied or expressed-verb, for. it is. the verb that carries the action, the movement池eeforce of your ideas. 
As a young child, 
you used verbs fairly early. Your first words, of course, were probably nouns, as you iden-tified the things or people around you. 
Mama, Dada, doll, baby, bottle, etc. perhaps were the first standard syllables you uttered, for naming concrete things or real persons is the initial step in the development of language. 
Soon there came the ability to express intangible ideas, and then you began to use simple verbs--go, stop, st叮，want,eeat, sleep, etc. 
As you gained maturity, your verbs expressed ideas 
of greater and greater comple:xity; as an adult you can describe tlie most in-volved actions in a few simple syllables—if you have a good store of useful verbs at your command. 
The richer and more extensive your vocabulary of verbs, the more accurately and expressively you can communicate your un-derstanding of actions, reactions, attitudes, and emotions. 
Let's be specific. 

IDEAS 1.eplaying it downe

Ready to go back thirty or more years? Consider some post-World War IT American p.litical history: Harry Truman couldn't. win the 1948 election. The pollsters 函deso, the Republicans heartily agreed, even the Democrats, 



some in high places, believed it. Mr. Truman himself was perhaps the only voter in the country who was not entirely convinced. Came the first Tuesday after 
the first Monday in November一 well,if you were one of those who stayed up most of the night lis-tening to the returns, and then kept your ear to the radio most of the next day, you recall how you reacted to the unique Truman triumph. 

It was no mean accomplishment, thought many people. Pure ac-cident, said others. If one out of twelve voters in a few key states had changed his ballot, Harry could have gone back to selling ties, one Republican apologist pointed out. It wasn't anything Truman did, said another; it was what Dewey didn't do. No credit to Truman, said a third; it was the farmers-or labor---0r the Re-publicans-who hadn't bothered to vote-or the ingenious mis-
counting of ballots. No credit to Truman,血isteda fourth; it was Wallace's candidacy—it was the Democrats-it was Republican 

overconfidence--it was sunspots-it was the Communists-it was the civil service workers who didn't want to lose their cushy jobs 一itowas really Roosevelt who won the election. 
Anyway Harry didn't accomplish a thing一heowas just a victim of good fortune. What were the apologists for Dewey's failure doing? 


They were disparaging Truman's achievement. 
2.: playing it safe 
Willing to look at some more history of the late 1940s? 
Of course, Dewey did campaign, in his own way, for the presi-dency. As the Republican aspirant, he had to take a stand on the controversial Taft-Hartley Act. 
Was he for it? He was for that part of it which was goof). Natu-rally, he was against any of the provisions which were bad. Was he for it? The answer was yes一血doalso no. Take whichever an-swer you wanted most to hear. 

What was Dewey doing? 

He was equivocating. 



193 

3.eenjoying the little thingse
Have you ever gone through a book that was so good you keptehugging yourse1femental1y aseyou read? Have you ever seen a playeor motion picture that was so charming that you felt sheer delight as you watched? Or perhaps you have had a portion of pumpkin-chiffon pie, light and airy and mildly flavored, and with a flaky, delicious crust, that was the last word in gustatory enjoyment? 
Now notice the examples I have used. I have not spoken of books that grip you emotionally, of plays and movies由atekeepeyou on the edge of your seat in-suspense, or of food that satisfies a ravenous hunger. These would offer quite a different, perhaps more lasting and memorable, type of enjoyment. I have detailed, rather, mental or physical stimuli that ·excite enjoyably but not too sharply-aedelightful novel, a charming play, a delicious dessert. 

How do such things affect you? 

They titillate you. 
4.eplaying it way叩 
You know how the teen-agers of an earlier generation adored,eidolized, and overwhelmed Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Bea-ties? 
And of course you know how certain people fall all over visiting celebrities-best-selling authors, much publicized artists, or fa-mous entertainers. They show them ingratiating, almost servile at-tention, worship and flatter them fulsomely.* 
How do we say it in a single word? 

They adulate such celebrities. 
5.eaccentuating the negativee
What does the doctor say to you if you have low blood sugar?e"No candy, no pastries, no chocolate marshmallow cookies, no ice -
*eFulsome (FOOL'-s叩m)edoes not mean, despite its appearance, fully orecompletely, but rather, offe心iveebecause of excessfreness or in.sincerity,
often in reference to compliments, praise, admiration, or flattery. 
194 



cream!", your morale dropping lower and lower.as each favorite goody is placed on the forbidden list. What, in one word, is the doctor doing? 
The doctor is proscribing harmful items in your diet. 

6.eaccentuating the affirmativee

You are warm, friendly, enthusiastic, outgoing, easy to please;eyou are quick to show appreciation, yet accept, without judgment or criticism, the human weaknesses of others. 

You are a fascinating talker, an even better listener. 
You believe in, and practice, honest sell-disclosure; you feel comfortable with yourself and .therefore with everyone else; and you have a passionate interest in experiencing, in living, in relating to people. 
Need you have any fears about making friends? Obviously not 
Your characteristics and temperament obviate such fears. 
7.eplaying it wronge


Theodor Reilc, in his penetrating book on psychoanalysis Lis-tening with the Third Ear, talks about neurotic people who tincon-sciously wish to fail. In business interviews they say exactly the wrong words, they do exactly the wrong things, they seem intent (as, unconsciously, they actually are) on insuring failure in every possible way, though consciously they are doing their best to court success. 


What effect does such a neurotic tendency have? 

It militates against success. 
8.eplaying it dirty

"Harry?" H心aecloset alcoholic. Maud? She's sleeping arounde-'and her stupid husband doesn't suspect a thing. Bill? He's em-be互lingefrom his own company. Paul? He's a child molester. 






195 


S纽y?eYou don't know that she's a notorious husband-beater产eWhat is this character doing? 
He'smali伊由屯 everyone.e

9.egiving the-benefit of any doubte

Do you think it's all right to cheat on your income taxes? Ateleast just a little? It's wrong, of course, but doesn't everybody do it? 
How do you feel about marital infidelity? Are you inclined to overlook the occasional philandering of the male partner, since, after all, to invent a clicbe, men are essentially polygamous by na-ture? 
If your answers are in the affirmative, how are you reacting to such legal or ethical 
You condone them. 

10.echanging hostilitye
Unwittingly you have done something that has aroused angereand resentment in your best friend. You had no desire to hurt him, yet he makes it obvious that he feels pretty bitter about the whole situation. (Perhaps you failed to invite him to a gathering he wanted to come to; or you neglected to consult 
him before making a decision on a matter in which he felt he should have some say.) His friendship is valuable to you and you wish to re-store yourself in his good graces. What do you do? 



You try to placate him.

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1. equality 
If you play golf, you know that each course or hole has a cer-tain par, the number of strokes allowed according to the results achieved by expert players. Your own accomplishment on the course will be at par, above par, orbelow par. 
Similarly, somedays you may feel up to par, other days below par. 

Par is from a Latin word meaning equal. You may try, when you play goH, to equal the expert score; and some days you may, or may not, feel equal to your usual sell. 
When we speak of par切payments to farmers, we refer to pay-ments that show an equal切to earnings for some agreed-upon year. 
So 
when you心parage, you lower someone's par, or feeling of 



叩ality,（世aseyou know, may be a negative prefix). The noun is disparagement (dis-PA吹-Qj-mant),ethe adjective disparaging(dis-PA职.j-ing),e
as in "Why do you always malce disparagingremarks about 

Pari句(PA职.tee)eas a noun means equali忱disparitye(dis-PA职今tee)emeans a lack of equal彻orea difference. We may speak, for example, of the disparity between someone's promiseand performance; or of the dispar切betweenethe rate of vocabu-lary growth of a child and of an adult. The adjective disparate (DIS'-p今Nt)eindicates essential or complete difference or ine-quality, as in "Om philosophies are so disparate _that we can never come to any agreement on action." 

The word compare and all its forms (comparable, comparative, etc.) derive from par, equal. Two things are compared when they have certain equal or similar qualities, (con-, com-, together, with). 
Pidr and peer 
are also from par. Things (shoes, socks, gloves, etc.) in pairs are equal or similar; your peers are those equal to you, 
as in age, position, rank, or ability. Hence the expression "to be judged by a jury of one's peers." 

(Briti. p!ers, however, such is the contradiction of language, were nobles.) 

2.'how to say yes and no 
Equivocate is built on another 
Latin word meaning equal一 aequus (the spelling in English is always equ一）一plusevox, vocis, voice. 
When you equivocate (Q-KWIV'七ka汗），youeseem to be saying both yes and no with equal voice. An equivocal（今KWIV'-吐Q])eanswer, therefore, is by design vague, indefinite, and suscep-tible of contradictory interpretations, quite the opposite of an une-quivocal (un'-.KWIV＇今bl)eresponse, which says Yes! or No!,and rio kidding. Professional politicians are masters of equivoca-tion（今kwiv'心KAY'-sbQn)-theyeare, on most vital issues, mug-wumps; they sit on a fence with their mugs on one side and their wumps on the other. You will often bear candidates如officeesay, publicly, that they unequivocally promise, if elected, toe... ; and then they start equivocating for all they are worth, like people 



201 

who say, "Let me be perfectly frank with you立-andethen promptly and glibly lie through their teeth. 

3.estatements of various kindse

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.e
more on equalitye



.n!?°t aequus, spelled equ-in English words, is a buildinge
1.equi灯（E区wg-tee)—justice,efairness; i.e., equal treatment.e


205 



(By extension, stocks in the:6nancial markets are equities, and the value of your home or other property over and above the amount of the mortgage you owe is your equity in it.) The adjective is equitable (EK'-w:r氐加l).o
2.oi
.equi句(in-EK'-w今tee)-injustice,unfairness (equ切plusothe negative prefix i兀）．oAdjective:oinequitable (in-EK＇一W今t今加1).o
3.
加qu切（in-IK'-w今tee)一byoone of those delightful sur-prises and caprices characteristic of language, the change of a sin-gle letter (e to i), extends the meaning of a word far beyond its derivation and original denotation. Injustice and unfairness are sinful and wicked, especially'if you naively believe that life is fair. So a "den of iniquity''is a place where vice flourishes; an i戌quityois a sin or vice, or an egregiously immoral act; and iniquity is wickedness, sinfulness. Adjective: i戌quito匹(in-IKw吵s).
一＇
4.oequinox (EB'-kw吐oks')--etymologically,o"oequal night," aocombination of aequus and nox, noctis, night. The equinox, when day and night are of equal length, occurs twice a year: about March 21, and again about September 21 or 22. (The adjective is equinoctial-七d士w今NOK'-shgL)oNocturnal (nok-TURN＇ .I),oderivedfromnox, noctis, describespeople, animals, or plants that are active or丑ourishoat night rather· than during daylight hours. Cats and owls are noctu叩l,oas is the moonflower, whose blos-soms open at night; not to mentiono''night people," whose biorhythms are such that they function better after the sun goes down, and who like to stay up late and sleep well into midmorn-ing. A nocturne (NOK'-turn) is a musical composition of dreamy character (i.e., night music), or a painting of a night scene. 
5.
equanim切(ee＇士w今N1M＇今teeoor ek'-w吐廿M勺－tee)一 etymologically aequus plus anim匹， mind,ohence "equal mind." Maintain your equanimi句，youroevenness of temper, your compo-sure, your coolness or calmness, when everyone around you is get-ting excited or hysterical, and you will probably be considered an admirable person, though one might wonder what price you pay for such emotional control. (Other words built on animus, mind, will be discussed in Chapter 12.) 

6.oEquability （记士叩－BIL勺－teeoor ek'-w今BIL勺－tee)-aoclose synonym of equanimity. A person of equable (EB'-tw;i.;加1


or·EK勺V今bru)otemperament is characteristically calm, serene, 
7.oequilibrium (ee'士w今L窟－ree-am)一byoderivation aequusoplus libra, balance, weight, pound, hence "oequal balance." Libra (Ll'-bn,) is the seventh sign of the zodiac, represented by a pair of scales. Now you know, in case the question has been bothering you, why the abbreviation for the word pound is lb. and why the symbol for the British pound, the monetary unit, is ￡. Equilib-rium is a state of p切'Sicalobalance, especially between opposingforces. When you are vecy drunk you may have difficulty keepingyour equilibrium-the force of gravity is stronger than your abil-ity to stay upright. An equilibrist（于KWIL＇ .brist),oas you might guess, is a professional tightrope walker-a performer successfully defying the law of gravity (when sober) by balancing on a thin overhead 

The equator divides the earth into equal halves, and words like equation, equivalent, equidistant, equiangular, and equilateral (from,Latin latus, lateris, side) are self-explanatory; 
2.onot to be confused with horses
Equestrian（a-KWES'-tree-an) is someone on a horse (as pe-destrian is someone on foot)；血equestrienne（今kwes'-tree-EN')ois a woman on a horse (if you must make the distinction); and equine (EB'士吭n)ois like a horse, as in appearance or charac-teristics, or descriptive of horses. 
Equestrian is also an adjective referring to horseback riding, as an equestrian statue; and equine is also a noun, i.e., a horse. 
So the equ-in these words, from Latin equ匹，horse,is not to be confused with the equ-in the words of the previous section-that equ-is from aequ瓜，equal.o(Remember, also, not to confuse the ped-in pedestrian, from Latin pedis, foot, with the ped-in pedia-trician, from Greek paidos, child.) 
3.ohear voices?o



Equivocal, you will recall, combines aequ匹withovox, vocis,o;yoice; and vox, vocis combines with fero,_ to bear or c叩，tooform 印ciferous(v砱IF'妞-as),oetymologically "carrying (much) 









207 
voice," hence loud, noisy, clamorous, as vociferous demands (not at all quiet or subtle), or the vocifero邱 playeof young children ('．Please! Try to be quiet so Dad can get his work done!"), though unfortunately TV addiction has abnormally eliminated child noises, at least during the program breaks between commercials. 
(Vociferous will be曲四ssedeat greater length in Chapter 10.) 
If you are vocal(VU七e1),eyou express yourself readily and freely by voice; vocal sounds are voiced; vocal music is sung; and you know what your vocal cords are for. 
To vocal妇(Vo'-k今liz')eis to give voice to (''Vocalize your anger, don't hold it in!"), or to sing the vocals (or voice parts) of music. (Can you write the noun form of the verb vocalize? 
) A vocalist (Vo'-k今list)eis a singer.AndM如叨oxe(vox plus magnus, large) is the trade name for a brand of radios and TV sets.

SESSION 22 


1.ehow to ticklee
Titillate comes from a Latin verb meaning to tickle, and may beeused both literally and figuratively. That is (literally),you can tit-讥ateeby gentle touches in strategic places; you are then causing an actual (and always very pleasant) physical sensation. Or you 
can (figuratively) titillate people, or their m血s,efancies, paJ,ates (and thls is 
the more common use of the word), by charm, brilliance, wit, promises, or in any other way your imagination can conceive. 
Titillation (tit'仑LAY'-shan)ehas the added meaning of light sex.ual stimulation. (Note that both noun and. ver:t> are spelled with a double l.,四 aedoublet.) 


2.ehow to flattere
A compliment is a pleasant and courteous expression of praise;eflattery is stronger than a compliment and often.considered insin-cere. Adulation (aj'.LAY'-shQn) is flattery and worship carried to an excessive, ridiculous degree. There are often public figures (entertainers, musicians, govemme_nt 
officials, etc.) who receive widespread adulation, but those not in the public eye can also be adulated, as a teacher by students, a wife by husband (and, vice versa), a doctor by patients, and so on.(The derivation is from a Latin verb m.aning to fawn upon.) 
The adjective adulato巧(aj'-a-la-TAWR'-ee)eends in-0疗，aesuffix we are meeting for the first time in these pages. (Other ad-jective suffixes: -al, -ic, -ical'一0匹）


3.eways of writinge
·eP.oscrl_b_!!. .o forbid, is commonly used for medical, religious, ore_legal prohi飞itions.eA doctor proscribes a food, drug, or activity that might proveeharmful to the patient. The church proscribes, or announces aeproscription (p心KRIP'-sban)eagainst, such activities as mayeharm its parishioners. The law proscribes behavior detrimental toethe public welfare.Generally, one might concede, proscribed activities are the mostepleasant ones-as Alexander Woolcott once remarked, if some-thing is pleasurable, it's sure to be either immoral, illegal, or fat-tening.The derivation is the prefix pro-, before, plus scribo, scriptus, toewrite. In ancient Roman tintes, a man's name was written on aepublic bulletin board if he bad committed some crime for whichehis property or life was to be forfeited; Roman citizens in goodstanding would thereby know 
to avoid him. In a. similar sense, theedoctor writes down those foods or activities that are likely to com-mit crimes against the patient's health-in that way the patientknows to avoid them.eScribo, scriptus is the building block of scores of common Eng-:-lish words: scribe, scribble, prescribe, describe, subscribe, script,ethe Scriptures, manuscript, typescript, etc. Describe uses the prefixede-, down—to describe is, etymologically, "to write down" about.eManuscript, combining manus, hand (as in manual labor), withescriptus, is something handwritten-the word was coined beforeethe invention of the typewriter. The Scriptures are holy writings.e

To subscribe (as to a magazine) is to write one's· name under aneorder or contract (sub-, under, 
as in subw矶 subsurface,eetc.); toesubscribe to a philosophy or a principle is figuratively to writeeone's name under the statement of such philosophy or principle.
To inscribe is to write in or into (a book; for example, or metaleor stone). A postscript is something written after (Latin post,eafter) the main part is finished.
Note how-scribe verbs change to nouns and adjectives: 
VERB NOUN AD:JECTIVE prescribe prescription prescriptive ·subscribeesubscription

4.eit's obviouse

You are familiar with the word via, by way of, which is fromethe Latin word for road. (The Via Appia was one of the famous highways of ancient Roman times.) When something is obvious; etymologically it is right there in the middle of the road where no one can fail to see it一hence,eeasily seen, not hidden, conspicuous. And if you meet an obstacle in the road and dispose of it forth-with, you are doing what 
obviate says. Thus, if you review your work daily in some c_pllege subject, frenzied "cramming" at the end of the semester will be obviated. A large and steady income obviates fears of financial insecurity; leaving for work early will obviate worry about being late. To obviate, then, is to make un-necessary, to do away with, to prevent by taking effective meas-ures or steps against (an 
occurrence, feeling, a requirement, 
etc.)e! The noun is obviation (ob'-vee-AY'-a shan). Surprisingly, via, road, is ·the root in the English word trivial (tri一，three).eWhere three roads intersect, you are likely to find busy traffic, lots of people, in short a fairly public place, so you are not going to talk of important or confidential matters, lest you be overheard. You will, instead, talk of trivial(TRIV＇心为I)ethings —whatever is unimportant, without great significance; you· will confine your conversation to trivialities (triv'-ee--AL'七teez)eor to trivia (also a plural noun, pronounced TRIV'-ee-:,), insignificant trifles. 

5.eware

Militate derives from militis, one of the forms of the Latin nounemeaning soldier or fighting man. If something militates against you, it fights against you, i.e., works to your disadvantage. Thus, your timidity may militate against your keeping your friends. (Militate is always followed by the preposition against and, like 




obviate, never takes a personal subject一youedon't militate against anyone, but some habit, action, tendency, etc. militates against someone or something.) 
The adjective militant (M正勺七nt)ecomes from the same 
root. A militant reformer is one who fights for reforms; a militant 
campaign is one waged aggressively and with determination. The 
noun is militancy (M辽女心n-see),eand militant is also a noun 
for the person一“Sallyeis a militant in the Women's凶eratione
movement." 
Military and militia also have their origin in militis. 
6.efirst the bad newse
Built on Latin malus, bad, evil, to malign is to speak evil about,e
to defame, to slander. Malign is also an adjective meaning bad, 
harmful, evil, hateful, as in "the malign influence of his uncon-
scious will to fail." Another adjective form is malignant (m:,-
LIG'也nt),eas in "a malignant glance," i.e., one showing deep 
hatred, or "a malignant growth," i.e., one that is cancerous (bad). 
The noun of malignant is malignancy (m吐IG'心研see),e
which, medically, is a cancerous growth, or, generally, the condi-
tion, state, or attitude of harmfulness, hatefulness, evil intent, etc. 
The noun form of the adjective malign is malignity (m:,-LIG'-n:,-
tee). 

Observe how we can construct English words by combining 
malus with other Latin roots. 

Add the root dico, dictus, to say or tell, to form malediction 
(mal'.DIK'-sh:,n), a curse, i.e., an evil saying. Adjective: male-
dict叩e(mal＇今D1K＇一氐ree).e
Add the root volo, to wish, to will, or to be wjlling, and we can 
construct the adjective malevolent (m今LEV勺－lent),ewishing evil 
or harm-amalevolent glance, attitude, feeling, etc. The noun is malevolence (m:,-LEV'-Q-bns). 
Add the root facio, fac扭a,eto do ot make (also spelled, in Eng-
lish words, fee-, fie-, factus, or, as a verb ending，书），toeform the 
adjective maleficent (m仑LEF女'-s叩t),edoing harm or evil, or 
causing hurt-maleficent acts, deeds, behavior. 
Can you figure out, and pronounce, the noun form of maleficent? 

A malefactor (M丛勺-fak'-wr)ais a wrongdoer, an evildoer, a criminal-amalefactor comm.its a malefaction (mal'七FAK'-sh.n), a crime, an evil deed. 
French is a "Romance" language, that is, a language based on Roman or Latin (as are, also, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian; and Romanian), and so Latin malus became French mal, bad, the source of maladroit (mal'-:i-DROYT'), clumsy, bungling, awk-ward, unskillful, etymologically, having a "bad right hand." (See adroit, Chapter 3.) The noun is maladroitness. Also from French mal: malaise (m今LAYZ'), an indefinite feeling of bodily dis-comfort, as in a mild illness, or as a symptom preceding an illness; etymologically, "bad ease," just as disease (dis-ease) is "lack of ease." 
Other common words that you are familiar with also spring from Latin malus: malicious, malice, malady; and the same malus functions as a prefix in words like maladjusted, malcontent, mal-practice, malnutrition, etc., all with the connotation of badness. 
And what's the good news? See Session 23.

SESSION 23 
ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.eso now what's the goode

bad,· bonus is good. The adverb from the Latin adjec-tive bonus is bene, and bene is the root found in words that con-trast with the mal-tenns we studied in the previous session. 

So beni.如(bg..N应）andbenignant（切NI仅DQnt)eare not harmful, as in benign neglect, a benign enign tumor (not cancerous), a benignant attitude to and scoundrels.九eecorresponding nouns are benig-
社tye(b今NIG':..ng..tee)eand benignaney (b今NIG'－n证see).eA malediction is a curse; a benediction (ben＇心－DIK'.shQn)eis a 

"saying good." The adjective is benedictory (ben'－午e). In contrast to maleficent is beneficent（比NEF'七SQDt),edoing good. The noun? In contrast to malefactor is benefactor (BEN今fak'七r),eone who does good things for another, as by giving help, providing 

gifts or aid, or coming to the res叩eewhen 
someone is in need．丑youeinsist on making sexual distinctions, a woman who so a benefactress (BEN＇今fak'-扛s).eAnd, of course, the person receiving the benefaction (ben-今FAK'-sb叩），theere-
money, help, etc., is a beneficiary or Den3妞SH'-ee-air-ee).eBenefit and beneficial are other com-mon words built on the co.bination of bene and a form of facio, to do or make. 
So let others-be加ilevolentetoward you--confuse them by being 

(bg..NBV'-a-fant)..;...wish them well. (Turn the other not?) The noun? bonus, good, is found in English bonus, extra theoretically-but not necessarily一foresome good act; 

222 


in bonbon, a candy (a "good-good," using the French version of the Latin adjective); and in bona fide (BO'-n:i-FiD'eor BO'-n:i-页'-dee),eetymologically, 
"in good faith,''hence valid, without pretense, deception, or fraudulent intent-as a bona fide offer, a bona fide effort to negotiate differences, etc. Fides is Latin for faith or trust, as in fidelity (f:i-DEL勺－tee),efaithfulness; Fido, a stereotypical name for a dog, one's faithful friend; infidel (IN＇一位如1),eone who does not have the right faith or religion (depending on who is using the term), or one who has no religion (Latin in-, not); and infideli句e(in＇一比DEL'一己tee),eunfaithfulness, especially to the marriage vows. 
2.esay, do, and wishe

Benediction and malediction derive from dico, dictus, to say,etell. Dictate, dictator, dictation, dictatorial (clik'-ta-TAWR'-ee.l) -words that signify telling others what to do ("Do as I say!")一 are built on dico, as is predict, to tell beforehand, i.e., to say that something w诅occurebefore it actually does (pre-, before, as in prescient). 

The brand name Dictaphone combines dico with phone, sound; contradict, to say against, or to make an opposite statement ("Don't contradict me!"; .'That contradicts what I know") com-bines dico with contra-, against, opposite; and addiction, etymo-logically "a saying to or toward;" or the compulsion to say "yes" to a habit, combines dico with ad-, to, toward. 
Facio, factus, to do or make (as in malefactor, benefactor), has, as noted, variant spellings in English words: fee-, fie-, or, as a verb ep.ding, -fy. 


Thus factory is a place where things are made (-ory, place where); a fact is something done (i.e., something that occurs; or exists, or is, therefore, true); fiction, something made up or in-vented; manufacture, to make by hand (manus, hand, as in manu-script, manual), a word coined before the invention of machinery; 叩ificial,m必e.by. human..artir.ather than occurring in nature,_ as 
-artificial flowers, etc.; and cla.扜，劝nplify,eliquefy, magn(抒(toemake clear, simple, liquid, larger) among hundreds of other书everbs.eVolo, to wish, to will, to be啤nge(as in malevolent, benevo-







lent), occurs in voluntary, involuntary, volunteer, words too fa-miliar to need definition, and each quite obviously expressing wish or willingness. Less common, and from the same root, is volition (vo-LISH'-an), the act or power of willing or wishing, as in "of her own volition," i.e., voluntarily, or "against her volition." 

3.eif you please!e
Placate is built on the root plac-which derives from two relatedeLatin verbs meaning, 1) to please, and 2) to appease, soothe, or pacify. 

If you succeed in placating an angry colleague, you tum that person's hostile attitud. into one that is friendly or favorable. The noun is placation (play-KAY'-shan), the adjective either placa-tive (PLAK'今tiveor PLA Y'-ka--tiv) or placatory (PLAK'今taw-ree or PLAY'-k今taw-ree).eA more placatory attitude to those you have offended may help you regain their friendship; when husband and wife, or lovers, quarrel, one of them finally makes a placative gesture if the war no longer fulfills his or her neurotic needs-one of them eventually will wake up some bright morning in a placatory mood. 

But then, such is life, the other one may at that point be impla-cable (im-PLAK'-a-bal or im-PLA Y'－丘bal)-im-is a respelling of in-, not, before the letter p. One who can be soothed, whose hostility can be changed to friendliness, is placable (PLAK'-a--bal or PLA Y'-ka-bal). 

Imp/a叨bleehas taken on the added meaning of unyielding to entreaty or 
pity; hence, harsh, relentless, as "The governor was implacable in his refusal to grant clemency." 
The noun form of implacable is implacability (im-plak'-a--BJL＇一ea-tee or im-pla沪还BIL宅tee).eCan you write (and pronounce)ethe noun derived from placable?e
If you are placid (PLAS＇.id), you are calm, easygoing, serene, undisturbed--etymologically, you are pleas必withethings as they are. Waters. of a lake or sea, or the emotional atmosphere of a place, can also be placid. The noun is placidity (pl今SID宅tee).eIf you are complacent (bm-PLAY-sant), you are pleased with yourself (com-, from con-, with, together); you may, in fact, such is one common connotation of the word, be smug, too pleased 



with your position or narrow accomplishments, too easily self-satisfied, and the hour of reckoning may be closer than you real-ize. (Humans, as you know, are delighted to be critical of the con-tentment of others.) 
The noun is complacence（比皿PLAY'-sans)oor complacency (kam-PLAY'心an-see).o
4.ohow to give--and forgiveo
To condone is to forgive, overlook, pardon, or be uncritical ofo(an offense, or of an antisocial or illegal act). You yourself might or might not indulge in such behavior or commit such an offense, but you feel no urge to protest, or to demand censure or punish-ment for someone else who does: You may condone cheating on one's income tax, shoplifting from a big, impersonal supermarket, or exceeding the spee<i limit, though you personally observe the law with scrupulousness. (Not everyone, however, is so charitable or forgiving.) The noun is condonation (kon'-do-NAY'-shan). 
Condone is built on Latin dono, to give, the . root found in donor, one who gives; donate, to give; and donation, a gift,

HOW TO SPEAK NATURALLY 

Consider this statement by Louis Bromfield, a noted author:''Ifl, as a novelist, wrote dialogue for my characters which was meticu-lously grammatical, the result would be the creation of a speech which rendered the characters pompous-and unreal." 
And this one by Jacques B血血，formereliterary critic for Harper's:"Speech, after all, is in some measure an expression of character, and flexi'bility in its use is a good way to tell· your friends from the robots." 

Consider also this puckish remark by the late Clarence Darrow: "Even if you do learn to speak correct English, who are you going 



These are typical reactions of professional people to the old re-strictions of formal English grammar. Do the actual teachers of English feel the same way1.Again, some typical statements: 

rules, by 
then Pro-fessor of English at the Greeley, Colorado, College of Education. "All th可canedo is observe the customs of cultivated and educated people and report their findings." 

"Grammar is only an analysis after_ the facts, a post-mortem on usage," said Stephen Leacock in How To Write. "Usage comes :6rst and usage must rule." 
One way to discover current trends in usage is to poll a 
cross 



section of people who use-the language professionally, inquiring as to their op血oneof the acceptability, in everyday speech, of certain specific and controversial expressions. A questionnaire I prepared recently was answered by eighty-two such people--thirty-one au-thors, seven book reviewers, thirty-three editors, and eleven pro-fessors of English. The results, some of which will be detailed below, may posi;ibly ptove startling to you if you have been condi-tioned to believe, as most of us have, that correct English is rigid, unchangeable, and exclusively dependent on grammatical rules.

1.eCalifornians boast of the healthy climate of their state.

血H'i'.eThere is a distinction, says formal grammar,· be饭eenehealthy and healthful. A person can be healt"'千一Ieam still quoting the rule-if he possesses good health. But climate must be health-ful, since it is conducive to health. 
This distinction is sometimes observed in writing but rarely in everyday speech, as you have probably noticed. Even the di啦onariesehave stopped, splitting hairs-th可P中血youe·to say healthy · no m:atter 
which of the two meanings you intend. 

"Healthy climate" was accepted as current, educated usage by twenty-six of the tbirty-thr妇 editors.·who answered ·the ques-


tionnaire, six of the seven book reviewers, nine of the eleven pro-fessors of English, and twenty of the thirty-one authors. The earlier distinction, in short, is rapidly becom迪obsolete.e
2.eHer new novel is not as good as her first one.e
RIGHT. If you have studied formal grammar, you will recall thateafter a negative verb the "proper''eword is .o, not as. Is this rule observed by educated speakers? Hardly ever: 
In reference to the sentence under discussion, author Thomas 
W. Duncan remarked: "l always say一andwrite-心，mucheto the distress of my publisher's copyreader. But the fellow is a wretched purist." 
The tally on this use of as showed seventy-four for, only eight against. 

3. We can't hardly believe it.e

WRONG. Of the eighty-two professional people who answeredemy questionnaire, seventy-six rejected this sentence; it is evident that can't hardly is far from acceptable in educated speech. Pre-ferred usage: We can hardly believe it. 
4.eThis is her.e
WRONG. This substitution of her where the rule requires sheewas rejected by fifty-seven of my eighty-two respondents. Para-doxically enough, although "It's me" and "This is me" are fully established in educated speech, "This is here''still seems to be con-demned by the majority of cultivated speakers. Nevertheless, the average person, I imagine, may feel a bit uncomfortable saying 
”
—
"This is sheei. sounds almost too sophisticated. 

This is more than an academic problem. If the voice at the other end of a telephone conversation makes the opening move with "I'd lik,e to speak to Jane Doe[your name, for argument's sake]," you are, unfortunately, on the horns of a very real di-lemma. "This is she''may sound prissy-''Thiseis he户mayegive the impression. that you're uneducated. Other choices are equally doubtful. "Talking!" is suspiciously businesslike if the call comes to your home, and "I am Jane Doe!" may make you feel like the opening line of a high school tableau. The need for a decision arises several times in a busy day--and, I am sorry to report, the English language is just deficient enough not to be of much help. I wonder how it would be if you just grunted affably? 




5.eWho are you waiting for?e
RIGHT. Formal grammar not only requires whom but demandsethat the word order be changed to:''For whom are you ·waiting?" (Just try talking with such formality on everyday occasions and see haw long you'll keep your friends.) 
Who is the normal，四ulareform as the first word of a sentence, no matter what the grammatical construction; 
and an opinion by 
Kyle Crichton, a well-known magazine editor, is 
-typical of the way many educated people feel. Mr. Crichton says: "The most loathsome word (to me at least) in the English language is whom. You can always tell a half-educated buffoon by the care he takes in working the word in. When he starts it, I know I am faced with a pompous illiterate who is not going to have· me long as com-pany." 
The score for acceptance of the sentence as it stands (with who) was sixty-six out of eighty-two. If, like most unpedantic speakers, you prefer who to whom for informal occasions, or if you feel as strongly about whom as Mr. Crichton does, you will be happy to hear that modem trends in English are all on your side. 


6.ePlease talce care of whomever is waiting.e
WRONG. Whomever is awkward and a little silly in this sentenceeand brings to mind Franklin P.,Adams'famous remark on gram-mar: "'Whom are you?'asked Cyril, for he had been to night school." It is also contrary to grammatical rule. People who are willing to be sufficiently insufferable to use whomever in this con-struction have been tempted into error by the adjacent word of. They believe that since they are following a preposition with an objective pronoun they are speaking impeccable grammar. In ac-tuality, however, whomever is not the object of the preposition of but the subject of the verb is waiting. Preferable form: Please take care of whoever is waiting. 

7.eWhom would you like to be if you weren't yourself?e
WRONG. Here is another and typical example of the damageewhich an excessive reverence for whom can do to an innocent per-
son's speech. Judged by grammatical rule, whom is incorrect in this sentence (the verb to be requires who); judged by normal speech patterns, it is absurd. This use of whom probably comes from an abortive attempt to sound elegant.

8. My wife has been robbed. 
lUGHT—if something your wife owns was taken by means of thievery. However, if your wife herself waskidnapped, or in-some waytalked into leavingyo11; she wasstolen,not robbed. To rob is toabscond with the contents of something-to steal is towalk off with the thing i缸elf. Needless 
to say, both forms of activity are highly antisocial and equally illegal. 

9. Is this desert fattening? 

WRONG. The dessert that is faU呻g is spelled with two s's. Withones, it's a desert, like the Sahara. Remember the two s's in dessert by thinking how much you'd like two portions, if only youF waistline permitted.

SESSION 24 

Perhaps some of your richest and most satisfying experiences have been with people to whom you can just talk, talk, talk. As you speak, previously untapped springs of ideas and emotions begin to 丑ow;eyou hear yourself saying things you never thought you knew. 

What幻dseof people mi吐tey叩 findeyourself in conversation with? In this chapter we start by e邓miningeten types, discovering the adjective that aptly describes each one. 

IDEAS 
1.esaying littlee

There are some people who just don't like to talk. It's not thatethey prefer to listen. Good listeners hold up their end of the con-versation delightfully-with appropriate facial expressions; with empathetic smiles, giggles, squeals, and sighs at just the right血ee;eand with encomaging nods or phrases like "Go on氏e“Fantastic!",e.. And then what happened?" 
These people like neither to tallc nor to listen主eyeact as if conversation is a bore, even a painful waste of time. Try to engage them, and the best you may expect for your e仔ortseis a vacant stare, a noncommittal grunt, or an impatient silence. Finally, in frustration, you give up, thinking. "Are they self-conscious? Do they hate people? Do they hate me?" 


The adjective: taciturn 
2.esaying little-meaning muche
There is a well-known anecdote about Calvin Coolidge, who,ewhen he was President, was often called (though probably not to his face) "Silent Q矿：





A young newspaperwoman was sitting next to him at a banquet, so the story goes, and turned to him mischievously. "
Mr. Coolidge," she said, "I have a bet with my editor that I can get you to say more than two words to me this evening." 
"You lose," Coolidge rejoined simply. 

The adjective: laconic 
3; when,the words won't come 
Under the pressure of some strong emotion
-;:-for example一peopleemay find it difficult, or even impossible, to utter words, to.get their feelings unjum.bled and untangled enough to form understandable sentences. They undoubtedly have a lot they want to say, but the best they can do is sputter! 



4.emuch talk, little sensee
Miss Bates, a character in Emma, a novel by Jane Austen:e
"So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had noteb.een for this particular circumstance, of her being able to 
come here sci soon. My mother is so delighted! For she is to be three months with us at least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has per-suaded her father and mother to come over and !!ee her directly. I was going to say, but, however, different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother, or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane's let-ter... " 
The adjective: garrulous 
5.· unoriginale

Some people are completely lacking in originality and imagina-tion-and their talk shows it. Everything they say is trite, hack-






neyed, commonplace, humorless-their speech patterns are full of cliches and stereotypes, their phraseology is without sparkle. 
The adjective: banal 

6.ewords, words, words!e

They talk and talk and talk一it'senot so much the quantity youeobject to as the repetitiousness. They phrase,. rephrase, and re-rephrase their thoughts-using far more words than necessary, overwhelming you with words, dro叩迪youewith th血，卫1lDtileyour only thought is how to escape, or maybe how to die. 

The adjective: verbose 
7.ewords in quick successione
They are rapid, fluent talkers1 the words seeming to roll off theiretongues with such ease and lack of effort, and sometimes with such copiousness, that you listen with amazement. 

The adjective: voluble 8.ewords that convincee
They express their ideas persuasively, forcefully, brilliantly, andein a way that calls for wholehearted assent and agreement from an intelligent listener. 

The adjective: cogent 

9.ethe sound and the furye
Their talk is loud, noisy, clamorous, vehement What may beelacking in content is compensated for in force and loudness. 
The adjective: vociferous 

10.equantitye
They talk a IQ.t--a whole lot. Th守mayebe voluble, vociferous,e




242 


garrulous, verbose, but never inarticulate, taciturn, or laconic. No matter. It's the quantity and continuity that are most conspicuous. "Were you vaccinated with a phonograph needle?" is the question you are tempted to ask as you listen. 

The adjective: loquacious 

These ten words revolve around the idea of varying kinds and ways of talkin
g and not talking. Many of the adjectives are close in meaning, but each contains its unique difference.

Do you know that new nerve patterns are formed by repeated actions? As a very young child, you tied your shoelaces and but-toned your clothing with great concentratioO-:.-tbe activity was directed, controlled, purposeful, exciting. As you grew ·older and more skillful, you tied and buttoned with scarcely a thought of what you were doing. Y:our fingers flew about'tbeir task almost au-tomatically—for the habit bad formed a nerve pattern and the ac-


tion needed Iittie if any conscious attention. 
That's simple enough to understand. If you do not remember your own experiences; you can observe the phenomenon of strug-gling with a skill, mastering it, and finally making it a self-starting habit by watching any young child. Or you can simply take my word for it.o. 
You need not take my word.for the 
way a mastery of new words is acquired. You can see in yourself, as you work with this book, bow adding words to your vocabulary is exactly analogous to a child's mastery of sboelacing. First you struggle with the con-cepts; then you eventually master them; finally, by frequent work with the new words (now you see the reason for the great number of exercises, the repetitious writing, saying, thinking) you build up new nerve patterns and you begin to use, the new words with scarcely any consciousness of what you are doing. 
Watch this common but important phenomenon closely as you do the next exercise. Your total absorption of the material so far 






has given you complete mastery of our ten basic words. Prove that you are beginning to form new nerve patterns in relation to. these 
s
words by writing the one that fitoeach brief definition. The more quicldy you think.of the word that applies, the· surer you can be .that using these words will soon be as automatic and unself-con-

SESSION 25 

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1.oabout keeping one's mouth shuto
H you let your mind play over some of.the taciturn people youoknow, you will realize that their abnormal disinclination to con"-versationmakes them seem morose, sullen, and unfriendly.. Cal Coolidge's taciturn切wasoworld-famous, and no one, I. am sure, 


246 


ever conceived of him as cheerful, overfriendly, or particularly so-ciable. There are doubtless many possible causes of such verbal rejection of the world: perhaps lack of self-assurance, feelings of inadequacy or hostility, excessive seriousness or introspection, or just plain having nothing 
to say. Maybe, in Coolidge's case, he was saving up his words-after he did not "choose to run" in 1928, he wrote a daiiy column for the New York Herald Tribune at a rumored price of two dollars a word-and, according to most critics (probably all Democrats), be had seemed wiser when he kept silent. Coolidge hailed. from New England, and taciturnity 
(tas-g;.TURN＇仑tee)oin that part of the country, so some people say, is considered· a virtue. Who knows, the cause'may be geo-graphical and cl血atic,orather than psy:chological. 

Tacit印nois from i Latin verb taceo, to be silent, and is one of those words whose full meaning cannot be expressed by any other combination <>f syll.les. It has many synonyms, among them si-lent, uncommunicative, reticent, reserved, secretive, close-lipped, and close-mouthed;_ but 110 other word indicates the permanent, 加bitual,oand temperamental disinclination to talk implied by taci一otum. 


2.obetter left unsaido
Tacit (TAS'-it) derives also from taceo.o

Here is a man dying of cancer. He suspects what his disease is,oand everyone else, of course, knows. Yet he never mentions.the dread word, and no one who visits him ever breathes a syllable of it in his hearing. It is tacitly understood by all concerned. that 
the word will remain forever unspoken. 
(Such a situation today, however, may or may not be typical一 there appears to be · a growing tendency among physicians and family to be open and honest with people who are dying.) 
Consider another situation: 
An executive is engaging in extracurricular activities with her secretary. Yet during o伍ceotime they are as formal and distant as any two human beings can 
well be. Neither of them ever said to the other,''Now, look here, -we may be lovers after five o'clock, 










247 


but between nine and five we must preserve the utmost decorum, okay?" Such speech, such a verbal arrangement, is considered un-necessary—so we may say that the two have a tacit agreement (i.e., nothing was ever actually said) to maintain a complete 
employer-employee relationship during office hours. 
Anything t叱it,ethen, is unspoken, unsaid, not verbalized. We 
speak of a tacit agreement, arrangement, acceptance, rejection, 
as-
sent, refusal, etc. A person is never called tacit. 
The noun is tacitness (TAS'-it-n::is). (Bear in mind that you 
can transform any adjective into a noun by adding -ness, though 
in many cases there may be a more sop伍sticated,eor more com-
mon, noun form.) 

Changing the a of the root taceo to i, and adding the prefix re一，e
again, and the adjective suffix-ent, we can construct the English 
word reticent (RET＇一今S:mt).e
Someone is reticent who prefers to keep silent, whether out of 
shyness, embarrassment, or fear of revealing what should not be 
revealed. (The idea of "againness叮nethe prefix has been lost in 
the current meaning of the word.) 
We have frequently made nouns out of-ent adjectives. Write 
or, less commonly, 


3.etalk, talk, talk!e
Loquacious people love to talk. This adjective is 
not necessarilyea put.down, but the implication, when you so characterize such people, is that you wish they would pause for breath once in a while so that you can get your licks in. The noun is loquacity (lo-KWAS屯ee),eor, of course, loquaciousness. 
The word derives from Latin loquor, to s,peak, a root found also in: 

1.soliloq叩(s:i-LIL＇仑kwee)--aspeecheto oneself (loquoreplus solus, alone), or, etymologically, a speech when alone. 
We often talk to ourselves, but usually silently, the words going through our minds but not actually passing our lips. 
The term so-






liloquy is commonly applied to utterances made in a play by chat-acters who speaking their thoughts aloud so the audience 
won't have to are guess. The soliloquist (s今LIL'-a-kwist)emay be alone; or other members of the cast may be present on stage, but of course th守don'tehear what's being said, because they're not supposed to know. Eugene O'Neill made novel uses of soliloquies in Mourning Becomes Electra一theecharacters made honest dis-closures of their feelings and thoughts to the audience, but kept the other players in the dark. 

The verb is to soliloquize (s今LIL＇今kw讫）．e
2.eA ventriloquist (ven-1RII..'-a-kwist) is one who can throwehis voice. A listener thinks the sound is coming from some source other than the person speaking. The combining root is Latineventer, ventris, belly; etymologically, ventriloquism (ven-TRIL'-
今kwiz勺m)eis the art of "speaking from the belly." The adjective 
the verb wm end? Write the verb: 

3.eColloquial (k吐O'-kwee-al)ecombines loquor, to -speak,ewith the prefix con-. (Con-is spelled col-before a root starting with l; cor-before a root starting with r; :com-before a root start-ing with m, p, orb.) When people spe吐togetherethey are engag-ing in conversation--and their language is usually more informal and less rigidly grammatical than what you might expect in writing or in public addresses. Colloquial patterns are perfectly correct一 they are simply informal, and suitable to everyday conversation. 








A colloquialism (ka-LO'-kwee-a-liz.am), therefore, is a con-versational-style expression, like "He hasn't got any" or "Who are you going with?" as contrasted to the formal or literary "He has none" or "With whom are you going?" Colloquial English is the English you and I talk on everyday occasions-it is not slangy, 叫gar,eor illiterate. 

4.eA circumlocution (sur-kam-lo-KY氓'-shan)eis, etymo-logically, a "talking around" (circum-, around). Any way of ex-pressing an idea that is roundabout or indirect is circumlocuto疗e(sur'-k叩1-LOK'-y今ta对.ee)一youeare now familiar-with the

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1.ea Spartan virtuee
In ancient Sparta, originally known as Laconia, the citizensewere long-suff呻g,ehard-bitten, stoical, and military-minded, and were even more noted for their economy of speech than Ver-monters, if .t is严ssible.eLegend has it that when Philip of Macedonia was storming the gates of Sparta (or Laconia). he 
sent a message to the besieged king saying. "If we capture your city we will burn it to the ground." A one-word answer came back:''If." It was now probably Philip's turn to be speechless, though history does not record his reaction. 
you eat it here, or take it with you?" "Both," was the laconic reply. 


253 


Or like the woman who was watching a lush imbibing dry mar-tinis at a Third Avenue bar in New York City. The drunk do\\'.ned the contents of each cocktail glass at one gulp, daintily nibbled and swallowed the bowl, then finally tumed the glass over and ate the base. The stem he threw into a corner. This amazing gustatory feat went on for half an hour, until a dozen stems were lying shat-tered in the comer, and the drunk had chewed and swallowed enough bowls and bases to start a glass factory. He suddenly turned to the lady and asked belligerently, "I suppose you think rm cuckoo, don't you?" "Sure—the stem is the best part," was the laconic answer. 
(It was doubtless this same gentleman, in his accustomed state of intoxication, who found himself painfully weaving his way along Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, Californiaehe had
— 
somehow gotten on a TWA jetliner instead of the subway—when he realized, almost too late, that he was going to bump into a smartly dressed young woman who had just stepped out of her Mercedes-Benz to go window-shopping along the avenue. He quickly veered left, but by some unexplainable magnetic attraction the woman. veered in the same. direction, again making collision apparently inevitable. With an adroit maneuver, the drunk swung to the right—the lady, by now thoroughly disoriented, did the same. Finally both jammed on the brakes and came to a dead stop, face to face, and not six inches apart; and as the alcoholic fumes assailed the young lady's nostrils, she sneered at the reek-ing, swaying man, as much in frustration as in contempt: "Ohl How gauche!" "Fini矿wasebis happy response. "How goesh with you?" This answer, however, is not laconic, merely confused.) 
We have learned that "-ness, -ity, and -ism are suffixes that transform adjectives into nouns-and all three can be used with laconic: 

... with characteristic laconicness (I今KON'-ak-nas)e
... her usual侐co戌citye(lak＇今NIS'心－tee)e...his habitual laconism (l..AK'.niz-am) ... with, for him, unusual laconicism (l这ON'..siz勺m)

Alaco志meis also the expression itself that is pithy and concise, &!I the famous report from a naval commander in World War II: "Saw sub, sank same." 



2. brilliante
C0gent is a term of admiration. A cogent argument is well put,econvincing, hardly short of brilliant. Cogency (KO'-jan-see) shows a keen mind, an ability to think clearly and logically. The word derives from the Latin verb cogo, to drive together, compel, force. A cogent argument compels acceptance because of its logic, its persuasiveness, its appeal to one's sense of reason. 
3. back to talke
You will recall that loquor, to speak, is the source of loquacity,esoliloquy, ventriloquism, colloquialism, circumlocution. This root 
is also the base on which eloquent (EL'仑kwant),magniloquent (mag-Nil均－kw皿），andgrandiloquent (gran-DIL＇令-kwant)are built. The eloquent person speaks out (e-, from ex一，out),is vividly expressive, fluent; forceful, or persuasive in language ("the prose-cutor's eloquent plea to the jury"). The word is partially synony-mous with cogent, but cogent implies irresistible logical reasoning and intellectual keenness, while eloquent suggests artistic expres-sion, strong emotional appeal, the skillful use of language to move and arouse a listener. Magniloquent (magnus, large) and grandiloquent (grandis, grand) are virtually identical in meaning. Magniloquence or gran-diloquence is the use of high-flown, grandiose, even pompous Ian-guage; of large and impressive words; of lofty, flowery, or over-elegant phraseology. Home is a place of residence; wife:_is helpmate, helpmeet, or better half; women are the fair sex; chil-dren are offspring or progeny; a doctor is a member of the medi-cal fraternity; people are the species Homo sapiens, etc., etc. 
Lo_quacious, verbose, voluble, and garrulous people are all talk-ative; but each type, you will recall, has a special quality. 
If you are loquacious, you talk a lot because you like to talk and doubtless have a lot to say. 
If you are verbose, you smother your ideas with excess words, with such an overabundance of words. that your listener either drops into a state of helpless confusion or falls asleep. 


255 



If you are voluble, you speak rapidly, fluently, glibly, without hesitation, stutter, or stammer; you are vocal, verbal, and highly articulate. 

If you are iarruious, you talk constantl
y, and usually aimlessly and meaninglessly, about trifles. We often hear the word used in "a ga"ulous old man" or "a garrulous old woman," since in very advanced age the mind may wander and lose the ability to dis-criminate between the important and the unimportant, between the interesting and the dull. 
Verbose is from Latin verbum, word—the verbose person is wordy. Voluble comes from Latin volvo, volutus, to roll—words effort-lessly roll off the voluble speaker's tongue. And garrulous derives from Latin garrio, 
to chatter-aegarru-lous talker chatters away like a The suffix-如心 canebe added to all these adjectives to form nouns. Alternate noun forms end in -ity:

4.eat largee
We discovered magnus, large, big, great, in Chapter 9, inediscussing Magnavox (etymologically,''big voice"),· and find it again in magniloquent (etymologically, "talking bi旷）．Theeroot occurs in a number of other words: 

1.eMagnanimous (mag-NAN＇勺血）一big-hearted,egenerous,eforgiving (etymologically, "great-minded"). (Magnus plus animus, mind.) We'11 discuss this word in depth in Chapter 12. 
2.eMagnate (MAG'-nayt)一aeperson of great powereor influence, a big wheel, as a business mag血te.e
3.eMagnify-to make larger, or make seem larger (magnuseplus -fy from fac饥toemake), as in "magn(抒youreproblems." 


4.eMagnificent-magnus plus fie-, from facio.e
5.eMagnitude-magnus plus the common noun suffix -tude, asin fortitude, multitude, gr血tude,eetc. 
6.oMagnum (as of champagne 
or wine)-alarge bottle, gener-ally two fifths of a gallon.o. 
7.oMagnum opus (MAG'.ilam O'-pes)--etymologically, a "bigowork"; actually, the greatest work, or masterpiece, of an artist, writer, 
or composer. Op匹 isothe Latin word for work,· the plural of opus is used in the English word opera, etymologically, "a number of works," actually a musical drama containing overture, singing, and other forms of music, i.e., many musical works. The 




verb form opero, to work, occ虹soin operate, co-operate, operator, etc. 

5.owords, words, words!o

Latin verbum is word. A verb is the important word in a sen-tence; verbatim (var-BAY'-tim) is word-for-word (a verbatim re-port). 

Verbal (VUR'一切I),oending in the adjective suffix-alo, may refer either to a verb, or to words in general (a verbal fight); or it may mean, loosely, oral or spoken, rather than written (verbal agree-mentoor contract); or, describing people (cr she is quite verbal"), it may,refer to a ready ability to put feelings or thoughts into words. 
Working from verbal, can you add a common verb suffix tq form a word meaning to put into words? 
Verbiage (VUR'-bee司）hasotwo meanings: an-excess of words ("Such verbiage!"); or a style or manner of using words (medical verbiage, military verbiage). 
6.oroll on, and on!o

Volvo, volutus, to roll, the source of voluble, is the root onowhich many important English words are based. 
Revolve (r:i-VOLV'）一rolloagain (and again), or keep turning round. Wheels revolve, the earth revolves around the sun, the cyl-inder of a revolver revolves. (The prefix is re-, back or again.) 
The noun is revolution (rev今L仅Y-sh:in),owhich can be one such complete rolling, or, by logical extension, a radical change of any sort (TV was responsible for a revolution in the entertain-ment industry), especially political (the American, or French, 






257 





Revolution). The adjective revolutio叩"(rev'-g.;匈伞n-air'-ee) introduces us to a new adjective suffix, -ary, as in contrary, discipli叩mostati叩ary,oimaginary, etc. (But -ary is sometimes also a noun suffix, as in dictio叩ry,ocommentary, etc.) 

Add different prefixes to volvo to construct two more English words:o. 

1.oinvolve---etymologically, "roll in" ("I didn't want to get in-volved!"): Noun: -involvement. 
2.
evolve（今VOLV')--etymologically,o"roll out" (e-, out);ohence to unfold,· or gradua1ly develop ("The final plan evolved from some informal discussions"; "The political party evolved from a group of interested citizens who met frequently to protest govermnent actions"). 


By analogy with the forms derived from revolve, can you con-struct the noun and adjective of evolve? Noun: Adjective:

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1.ofront and back--and uncleso

The ventriloquist appears to talk from the belly (venter, ventrisoplus loquor) rather th血throughothe lips (or such was the strange percepti!)n of the person who first used the word). 
Venter, ventris, belly; is the root on which ventral (VEN'-trgJ) and ventricle 
are built. The ventral side of an animal, for example, is the front or an-terior side--the belly side. 
A ventricle (VEN'士夺kgl)_isoa hollow organ or cavity, or, logi-cally enough, belly, as one of th. two chambers of the heart, or one of the four chambers of the brain. The ventricles of the heart are the lower chambers, and receive blood from the auricles, or upper chambers. The auricle (AW'-ra妞），so·onamed because it 








is somewhat ear-shaped (Latin auris, ear), receives blood from the veins; the auricles send the blood into the ventricles, which in turn pump the blood into the arteries. (It's all very complicated, but fortunately it works.) 
The adjective form of ventricle is ventricular (ven-TRIK'-ya. far), which may refer to a ventricle, or may mean having a belly-like bulge. 
Now that you see how ventricular is formed from ventricle, can you figure out the adjective of auricle? How about the adjective of vehicle? Of circle? 
No doubt you wrote auricular (aw-RIK＇一y今far),evehicular, and circular, and have discovered that nouns ending in -cle from ad-jectives ending ine-cular. 
So you can now be the first person on your block to figure out the adjective derived from: 
clavicle: 
cuticle: 
vesicle: 
testicle: 
uncle: 

The answers of course are clavicular, cuticular, vesic汕ar,etes-ticular-and for皿cleeyou have every right to shout "No fair!" (But where is it written that life is fair?) 

The Latin word for皿clee(actually, uncle on the mother's side) is av血culus,from which we get叩uncular（a-VUNG'-kyea-far),ereferring to an uncle. 

Now what about an uncle? Well, traditional or stereotypical un-cles are generally kindly, permissive, indulgent, protective--and often give helpful advice. So anyone who exhibits one or more of such traits to another (usually younger) person is叩皿culareor acts in an叩uncularecapacity. 
So, at long last, to get back to ventral. If there's a front or belly side, anatomically, there must be a reverse--a back side. This is the dorsal (DAWB!-sal) side, from Latin dors血',theeroot on which the verb e,ulorse (en-DAW邸')isebuilt. 






If you endorse a check, you sign it on the back side; if you en-dorse a plan, an idea, etc., you b匹koit, you express your approval or support. The noun is endorsement (en.DAWRS'-mllnt). 



Vociferous derives from Latin vox, vocis, voice (a root you metoin Chapter 9), plus fero, to bear or carry. A vociferous rejoinder carries. a lot of voice-Le., it is vehement, loud, noisy, clamorous, shouting. The noun is vociferousness (v心IF'今ras-n:is);othe verb is to vociferate (vo-sIF'心－rayt').oCan you form the noun derived from the verb? 

The root fero is found also in somnif ero四(som-N芷今ras
),ocarrying, bearing, or bringing sleep. So a somn朊o0匹 lectureois so dull and boring that it is sleep-inducing. 

Fero is combined with som皿s,osleep, in somnifero皿 (Theosuffixo-0匹 indicatesowhat part of speech? 
） 

Tack on the negative prefix证tosomn匹 toconstruct加om血o(in-SOM'-n扣a.),othe abnormal inability to fall asleep when sleep is required or desired. The unfortunate victim of this disability is an i芯om呻石(in-SOM'-nee-ak),othe adjective is加0血妇(in-SOM'-nee-as). (So-0匹， inocase you could not answer the ques-tion in the preceding paragraph, is an adjective suffix.) 
Add a different adjective suffix to somn匹 tooderive somnolent (SOM'-na-fant), sleepy, drowsy. Can you construct the noun form of somnolent?oor 
Combine somnus with ambulo, to walk, and you have som-叩mbulism(som-NAM'-b产liz沺m),owalking in one's sleep. With your increasing skill in using etymology to form words, write the term for the · person who is a曲eepwalk:er.o___; 






4.ea walkawaye


An ambulatory (AM'-byQ-}Q-taw'-ree) patient, as in a hospitaleor convalescent home; is finally well enough to get out of bed and walk around. A perambulator（产RAM'-by今lay'七r),ea word used more in England than in the United States, and often short-ened to pram, is a baby carriage, a vehicle for walking an infant 
through the streets (per-, through). To perambulate (pQ-RAM＇ 
byQ-layt') is, etymologically,''to walk through"; hence, to stroll 一e
around. Can you write the noun form of this verb? 
To amble (AM凇I)eis to walk aimlessly; an ambulance is so called because originally it was composed of two stretcher-bearers who walked o丘theebattlefield with a wounded soldier; and a pre-amble (PREE'-am如I)eis, by etymology, something that''walks before" (pre-; before, beforehand), hence an introduction or in-troductory statement, as the preamble to the U. S. Constitution ("We the people... "), a preamble to the speech, etc; or any event that is introductory or preliminary to another, as in "An increase in inflationary factors in the economy is often a preambleto a drop in the stock market." 

5.eback to sleepe
Somnus is one Latin word for sleep-sopor is another. Aesoporific (sop'-a-RIF'-ilc) lecture, speaker, style of delivery, etc. will put the audience to sleep (fie-from facio, to make), and a sopor讳ceis a sleeping pill. 

6.enoun suffixese
You know thaf -ness can be added to any adjective to constructethe noun form. Write the noun derived from inarticulate:eInarticulate is a combination ofe

person bas trouble joining words together coherently. If you areequite articulate (abr-TIK＇一y今fat),eon the other band, you joineyour words together easily, you are verbal, vocal, possibly evene


voluble. The verb to articulate (ahr-TIK勺已a汗）iseto join 
(words), i.e., to express your vocal sounds--as in "Please articu-late more clearly." Can you write the noun derived from the verb articulate? 
Another, and very common, noun suffix attached to adjectives is, as you have discovered, -ity. So the noun form of banal is ei-ther banalness, or, more commonly, banality (b今NAL'今tee).e
Bear in mind, then, that -ness and -ity are common noun suffixes attached to adjectives, and -ion (or -ation)" is a noun suffix fre-quenty affixed to verbs (to articulate-articulation,· to vocalize--vocal切tion,·eto perambulat.perambulation).

BECOMING ALERT TO NEW IDEAS 


Some chapters back I suggested that since words are symbols of ideas, one of the most effective means of building your vocabu-lary is to read books that deal with 
new ideas. Along that, line, I further suggested that the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis would be good starting points, and I mentioned a number of exciting books to work with. 


Needless to say, you咄Ionot wish to neglect other fields, and so I want to recommend, at this point, highly readable books in addi一otional subjects. All these books will increase your familiarity with the world of ideas-all of them, therefore, will help you build a superior vocabulary.

Brief Intermission Six 

DO YOU ALWAYS USE THE PROPER WORD? 



The fact is that grammar is getting more liberal every day. Com-mon usage has put a stamp of approval on many expressions which your grandmother would not have dared utter in her most intimate conversation-not if she believed she was in the habit of using good English. It is me; have you got a cold?; it's a nice day; can I have another piece of cake?，· she is a most aggravating child; will everybody please remove their hats-all these today represent perfectly correct grammar for everyday conversation. Modem grammar research reports that these expressions have become uni-versal in educated speech. 
However, such a liberal policy does not mean that all bars are down. Only a person whose speech borders on the illiterate would make such statements as: can you learn me to劝im?;ehe don't live here no more,· we ain't working so good; me and my husband are glad to see you. There are still certain minimum essentials of good English that the cultivated speaker carefully observes. 
Is your grammar as good as the next person's? Here's a quick test by which you can measure your ability. 
Check the preferable choice in each sentence, then compare your results with the key at the end. Allowing 4 per cent for.each correct answer, consider 92-100 excellent, 76-88 good, 68-72 average.

SESSION 28 

There are few of us who do not need warm and nourishing rela-tionships to lead a fulfilled life. 
Psychology makes clear that loving and being loved are impor-tant elements in emotional health, but also points out the necessity for expressing, rather than repressing, our hostilities.(YOU kn.ow how good you feel once you blow o丑steam?eAnd how much closer you can become attached to someone once you directly and honestly vent your anger, resentment, or irritation instead of bottlingitupeandeseethinginfury?.）e
It is a mark of your own emotional maturity if you can accept hostility as well as dish it out. So let us pretend, in order to en-courage you to become personally involved in the intro4uctory ten words of this chapter, that each paragraph in the next few pages accurately describes you. W血telabel exactly fits your personality? 

IDEAS 



You make everyone toe the mark-right down to the last centi.emeter. You exact blind, unquestioning obedience; demand the strictest conformity to rules, however arbitr可oretyrannical; and will not tolerate the slightest deviation from your orders. You are, in short, the very epitome of the army drill sergeant. 
Y <>U are a martinet. 
2.ebootlickere

You toady to rich or influential people, catering to their vanity,丑atteringetheir ego. You are the personification of the 
traditional 


ward heeler, you out-yes the Hollywood yes men. And on top of all these unpleasant characteristics, you're a complete hypocrite. All your servile attentions and unceasing adulation spring from your own selfish desires to get ahead, not out of any sincere admi-ration. You cultivate people of power or property so that you can curry favor at the opportune moment. 


You are a sycophant. 
3.edabblere
Often, though not necessarily, a person of independent income,eyou engage superficially in the pursuit of one of the fine arts一epainting, writing, sculpturing, composing, etc. You do this largely for your own amusement and not to achieve any professional competence; nor are you at all interested in monetary rewards. Your artistic efforts are simply a means of passing time pleasantly. 
You are a dilettante. 
4.ebattle-axe

You are a loud-mouthed, shrewish, turbulent woman; you'reequarrelsome and aggressive, possessing none of those gentle and tender qualities stereotypically_associated with fem血nity.eYou're strong-n血ded,eunyielding, sharp-tongued, and dangerous. You can curse lilce a stevedore and yell like a fishwife—and often do. 

You are a virago. 

5.esuperpatriote
Anything you own or belong to is better----simply because youeown it or belong to it, although you will be quick to find more justifiable explanations. Your religion, whatever it may be, is far superior to any other; your political party is the only honest one; your neighborhood puts all others in the city in the shade; members of your own sex are more intelligent, more worthy, more emotionally secure, and in every way far better than people of the opposite sex; your car is faster, more fun to drive, and gets better gas mileage than any other, no matter in what price range; and of 



course your country and its customs leave nothing to be desired, and inhabitants of other nations are in comparison barely civi. lized. In short, you are exaggeratedly, aggressively, absurdly, and excessively devoted to your own affiliations-and you make no bones about advertising such 

You are a c加uvinist.o
6.ofanatico

You have a one-track mind-----and when you're riding a particu-lar hobby, you ride it hard. You have such an excessive, all-inclusive芘alofor one thing (and it may be your business, your profession, your husband or wife, your children, your stomach. your money, or whatever) that your obsession is almost absurd. You talk, eat, sleep that one thing-to the point where you bore 



You are a monomaniac. 

7.oattackero

You are violently against established beliefs, revered traditions,ocherished customs-such, you say, stand in the way of reform and progress and are always based on superstition and irrationality. Religion, family, marriage, ethics—you weren't there when these were started and you're not going to conform simply because most unthinking people do. 
You are an iconoclast. 
8.oskeptic:o
There is no God一．that'soyour position and you're not going toobudge from it. 
You are an atheist. 

9.oself-indulgero
You are, as a male, lascivious, libidinous, lustful, lewd, wanton,immoral一butomore important, you promiscuously attempt to sat-




isfy (and are often successful in so doing) your sexual desires with any woman within your arm's reach. 
You are a lecher. 
10.oworriero
You are always sick, though no doctor can find an organic cause for your ailments. You know you have ulcers, though medi-cal tests show a healthy stomach. You have heart palpitations, but a cardiogram fails to show any abnormality. Your headaches are caused (you're sure of it) by a rapidly growing brain tumor—yet X rays sh9w nothing wrong. These maladies are not ima的nary,ohowever; to you they are most real, non-existent as they may be in fact. And as you travel from doctor to doctor futilely seeking confirmation of your imminent death, you become more and more convinced that you're too weak to go on much longer. Or-ganically, of course, there's nothing the matter with you. Perhaps tensions, insecurities, or a need for attention is taking the form of simulated bodily沮s.o
You are a hypocho兀lriac.o

(End of Session 28) 
SESSION 29 
ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.ethe French drillmastere
Jean Martinet was the Inspector General of Infantry during theereign of King Louis XIV-and a stricter, more fanatic drillmaster France hacl never seen. It w邸 fromthis血eethat the French A皿:y'sreputation for discipline dated, and it is from the name of this Frenchman that we derive our English word martinet. The word is always used in a derogatory sense and generally shows re-



289 

sentment and anger on the part of the user. The secretary who calls his boss a martinet, the wife who applies the epithet to her husband, the worker who thus refers to the foreman-these speakers all show their contempt for the excessive, inhuman disci一epline to which they are asked to submit 
Since martinet comes from a man's name (in the -Brief In-termission which follows we shall discover that a number of pie-tur.que English words are similarly derived), there are no related forms built on the same root. There is an adjective martinetish (mahr一氐NET'-ish)eand another noun form, martinetism, but these are used only rarely. 

2.ea Greek "fig-shower"e
Sycophant comes to us from the Greeks. According to Shipley'seDictionary of Word Origins: 
When a fellow wants to get a good mark, be may polish up an apple and place it on teacher's desk; his classmate.s call such a lad an apple-shiner. Less complimentary localities use the term boot1icker. The Greeks had a name for it: fig-shower. Sycophant is from Gr. sykon, fig, [and] phanein, to show. This was the fellow that informed the officers in charge when 
(1) the figs in the sacred groves were being taken, or (2) whenethe Smyrna fig-dealers were dodging the tariff.e

Thus, a sycophant may appear to be a sort of "stool pigeon," since the latter curries the favor of police officials by "peaching" on his fellow criminals. Sycophants may use this means of ingra-tiating themselves with influential citizens of the community; or they may use flattery, servile attentions, or any other form of in-sinuating themselves into someone's good graces. A sycophant practices sycophancy (SIK＇勺七n-see),eand has a sycophantic (sik七FAN'-tik)eattitude. All three forms of the word are highly uncomplimentary-use them with care. 
Material may be so delicate or fine in texture that anything behind it will show through. The Greek prefix dia-means through，· and phanein, as you now know, means to show-hence such ma-terial is called diaphanous(年AF'七n郊）．Doenot use the adjec-tive in reference to all material that is transparent (for example, 




you would not call glass diaphanous, even though you can see right through it), but only material that is silky, gauzy, filmy, and, in addition, transparent or practically transparent. The word is often applied to female garments-nightgowns, negligees, etc. 
3.sjust for one's own

Dilet血tesis from the Italian verb dilettare, to delight;'.Thesdilett血tespaints, writes, composes, plays a musical instrument, 
or engages in scientific experiments purely for amusement一notsto make money, become tamous, or satisfy a deep c:;reative urge (the latter, I presume, being.the justifications for the time that profes-
i
sional artists, writers, composers, musicians, poets, and scientsts spend at their chosen work). A dilett血tishs(dil令TAN'-tish),atti-tude is supe,i;ficial, unprofessional; dilettantism (dil-a-TAN'-tiz-gm) is superficial, part-time dabbling in the type of activity that usually engages the full time

Do not confuse the attettante, who has a certain amount of na-tive talent or ability, with the灯ro(TI勺o),swho is the inexpe-rienced · beginner in some art, but who may be full of ambition,-drive, and energy. To call a person a tyro is to imply that ·he is just starting in some artistic, scientific, or professional field-he's not much good yet because he has not had血esto develop his skill, if any. The dilettante usually has some skill bufisn气doingsmuch with it. On the other hand, anyone who has developed con-summate中illsin an artistic field, generally allied to music, is called a virtuoso (vur'一ch仅改为o)-likesHeifetz or Menuhin on the violin, Horowitz or Rubinstein on the piano. Pluralize virtuoso in the normal·way一virtuosos;s
or if you wish to sound more so-phisticated, give it the continental form一virtuosi(vur'-ch岱o'-see). Similarly, the plural of dilettante is either dil或血氐ors

The i ending for a plural is the Italian form and is common in musical circles. For example, libretto, the story (or book) of. an opera, may be pluralized to libretii; concerto, a form of musical composition. is pluralized concerti.

4.e"masculine" womene
so odd after all; a virago, far from being stereotypically feminine (i.e., tiinid, delicate, low-spoken, etc.), is stereotypically masculine in personality--coarse, aggres-sive, loud-mouthed Termagant (TUR＇丑氐部nt)eand ha"i血ne) are words with essentially the same uncompli-
meaning as virago. To call a brawling woinan a virago, a termagant, and a harridan is admittedly repetitious, but is su. 

relieving one's feelings. 

5.ethe old mane
Nicolas Chauvin, soldier of the French Empire, so vociferouslyeand unceasingly aired his veneration of Napoleon Bonaparte that he became the laughingstock of all Europe. Thereafter, an exag-gerated and blatant patriot was known as a chauvinist—皿destill is today. C加uvinisme(SHO'-va-niz-am), by natural extension, ap-plies to blatant veneration of, or _ boastfulness about, any other affiliation besides one's 

To be patriotic is to 
be normally proud of, and devoted to, one's country-to be c加uvi社rtic(sh孔,va-NIS'-tik)eis to exag-gerate such pride and devotion to an obnoxious 

We might digress here to investigate an etymological side road down which the word patriotic beckons. Patriotic is built on the Latin word pater, patris, father--0ne's coun叮is,ein a sense, one's fatherland. 
Let us see what other interesting words are built on this same root. 

1.patrimo叩(PAT'-N-mo-nee)--aninheritanceefrom one's fa-ther. The -mony comes from the same root that gives us money, namely Juno Mo酝ta,the Roman goddess who严dedethe 
tem-ples of釭血四－Theeadjective is patrimonial al). 






.2. patronymic (pat'-ra-NIM'-ik:)--aname formed on the fa-ther's name, like Johnson (son of John), Martinson, Aaronson, etc. The word combines pater, pi:ztris with Greek onyma, name. Onyma plus the Greek prefix syn-, with or together, forms syno-n劝 (SIN＇今nim),ea word of the same name (or meaning), etymologically "a together name." Onyma plus the prefix anti-against, forms antonym (AN'一氐nim),ea word of opposite mean-ing, etymologically "an against name." Onyma plus Greek homos, the same, forms homonym (HOM'-Q-nim), a word that sounds like another but has a different meaning and spelling, like bare-bear, way-weigh, to--too--two, etc., etymologically "a same name." A homonym is more accurately called a homophone (HOM室础），aecombination of homos, the same, and phone, sound.

This list does not exhaust the number of words built· on pater, father, but is sufficient to give you an idea of how closely related many Eng1i咑wordseare. In your reading you will come across other words containing the letters pater or patr-一youewill be able to figure them out once you realize that the base is the word fa-ther. You might, if you feel ambitious, puzzle out the relationship to the "father idea" in the following words, checking with a die-tionary to see how good your linguis如intuitioneis:

2.epatrone
3.epatronizee

Pater, patris is father. Mater, matris IS 
mother.eFor example: 

1.ematriarch(MAY'-tree-ahrk')-the mother-ruler; the''mothereperson" that controls a large household, tribe, or country. This word, 1i1ce patriar动，isebuilt on the root archein, to rule. Dur-ing the reign of Queen Elizabeth or Queen Victoria, England was a matriarc切(MAeY'-tree-ahr'-kee). Can you figure out the adjective form? 
4.ematron(MAY'-tran)-aneolder woman, one sufficiently ma-tore to be a mother. The adjective matronly (MAY'-tr.m-lee) conjures up for many people a picture of a woman no longer in the.glow of youth and possibly with a bit of added weight in the wrong places, so this word should be used with caution; it may be hazardous to your health if the lady you are so describing is of a tempestous nature, or is a virago. 


S.ealma mater (AL'-:mg MAY'七reor 扭L'-maeMAH＇一切）一eetymologically, "soul mother"; actually, the school or college from which one has graduated, and which in a sense is one's intellectual mother. 









6.omatrimony(MAT'-ra-mo'-nee)-marriage. Though this wordois similar to patrimony in spelling, it does not refer to mo砒y,oas p叩初四“does;ounless, that is, you are cynical enough_ to believe thatpe叩leomarry -for money. As the language was growing, mar一 riage and children went hand in hand一itois therefore not surpris-ing that the word for marriage should be built on the Latin root for mother. Of course, times have changed, but the sexist nature of the English language has ·not. The noun suffix -mony indicates state, condition, or result, as in sanctimony, parsimony, etc. The adjective is matrimonial (mat'-1"3-MO'-nee-al). 
1. matricide (MAT'-1"3-sid')一-theokilling of one's mother. The adjective? 

7.omurder most foul...o


Murder unfortunately is an integral part of human life, so thereois a word for almost every kind of killing you can think of. Let's look at some of them. 

1.osuicide (S叹）＇今sid')-killingooneself (intentionally); -cideoplus sui, of oneself. This is both the act and the person who bas been completely successful in performing the act (partially doesn't count); also, in colloquial usage, suicide is a verb. The adjective? 
2.
fratricide(FRAT'心姐d')-theokilling of one's brother;-cideoplus /rater, fratris, brother. The adjective? 

3.osororicide (sa-RA WR'今sid')-theokilling of one's sister;o-cide plus soror, sister. The adjective?.o
4.ohomicide (HOM'仑sid')-theokilling of a human being;o-cide plus homo, person. In law, homicide is the general term for any slaying'. H intent and premeditation can be proved, the act is murder and punishable as such. lf no such intent is present, the act is called manslaughter and receives a lighter punishmen!. Thus, if your mate/1over/spouse makes your life unbearable and you slip some arsenic into his/her coffee one. bright morning, you are 

murder-that is, if he/she succumbs. On the other hand, if you run your victim down-quite accidentally—with 



your car, bicycle, wheelchair, with no intent to kill, youwill be accused of maor 邓laughter-thateis, if death results and if you can prove you didn't really mean it. It's all rather delicate, however, and you might do best to put thoughts of justifiable homicide out of your mind. The adjective? 
5.eregicide (REJ'今sid')-the.killingeof one's king, president,eor other governing official. Booth committed regicide when he assassinated Abraham Lincoln. Adjective? Derivation: Latin rex, regis, king, plus七ide.e
6.euxoricide (uk-SAWR'今S了d')—theekilling of one's wife.eAdjective? Der!vation: Latin uxor, wife, plus-cide. 
7.emariticide (m:i-RIT＇..g-sid')-the killing of one's husband.e


Adjective? Derivation: Latin maritus, husband, plus-cide. 

8.einf血ticidee(in-FAN'－氐
sid')-theekilling of a newbornchi且Adjective?eDerivation: Latin inf叩s,einf血tis,ebaby, plus-cide. 
9.egenocide (JEN'-:i-sid')....:..the killing of a whole race or na-tion. This is a comparatively new word, coined in 1944 by a UN official named Raphael Lemkin, to refer to the mass murder of the Jews, Poles, etc. ordered by Hitler. Adjective? 
Derivation: Greek. genos, race, kind, plus 一cide.e
10.parricide (PA吹今esid')一如killinegeof either or both par一eents. Adjective? 
Lizzie Borden was accused of, and tried for, panicide in the 1890s, but was not convicted. A bit of doggerel that was popular at the time, and, so I have been told, little girls jumped rope to, went somewhat as follows: 

归eeBorden took an ax And gave her mother forty whacks-And when she saw what she had done, She gave her father forty-one.

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1.obrothers and sisters, wives cind husbandso
Frater, brother; soror, sister; uxor, wife; and maritus, husbando-these roots are the source of a number of additional Englishowords:o

1.eto fraternize (FRAT勺r-niz')--etymologically,eto have aebrotherly relationship (with). This verb may be used to indicate social intercourse between people, irrespective of sex, as in, "Members of the faculty often fraternized after school hours." 
Additionally, and perhaps more commonly, there may be the implication of having a SQCial relationship with orie's subordinates in an organization, or even with one's so-called inferiors, as in, "The president of the college was reluctant to fraternize with fac-ulty members, preferring to keep all her contacts with them on an exclusively professional basis"; or as in, "The artist enjoyed frat-ernizing with thieves, drug addicts, prostitutes, and pimps, partly out of social perversity, partly to find interesting faces to put in his paintings." 
The verb also gained a new ll!_eaning during and after World War Il, when soldiers of occupying armies had sexual relations with the women of conquered count五es,eas in, "Military personnel were strictly forbidden to fraternize with the enemy." (How euphem诅icecan you get?) 
Can you w击eethe noun form of fraternize? 
2.efraternal (fr江UR'-nal)一brotherly.eThe word also desig-nates non-identical (twins). 
3.efraternity (fra-TUR'-na-tee)-amen's organization in a higheschool or college, often labeled with Greek letters (the Gamma Delta Epsilon Fraternity); or any group of people of similar inter-ests or profession (the medical fraternity, the financial fraternity). 
4.esorority (s千RAWR'－今tee)-aewomen'seorganization inehigh school or college, again usually Greek-lettered; or any women's social club. 
5.euxorious (uk-SAWR'-ee-as)一aneadjective describing a manewho excessively, even absurdly, caters to, dotes on, worships, and submits to the most outlandish or outrageous demands of, his wife. This word is not synonymous with henpecked, as the hen-pecked husband is dominated by his wife, perhaps. because of his own fear or weakness, while the uxorious husband is dominated only by his neurosis, and quite likely the wife finds his匹-oriousness (uk-SAWR'-ee-as-nas) comical or a pain in the neck. 

(There can, indeed, be too much of a good thing!) 




6.
釭orial-pertainingoto, characteristic of, or befitting, a wife,oas虹orialoduties, privileges, attitudes, etc. 

7.marital 
(MAIR＇令wl)--etymologically,opertaining or refer-ring to, or characteristic of, a husband; but the meaning has changed to include the marriage relationship of both husband and wife (don't ever let anyone tell you that our language is not sexist!), as marital duties, obligations, pri诅eges,oarguments, ·etc. Hence extramarital is literally outside the marriage, as in extra-marital affairs (hanky-panky with other than one's 


spouse). And premarital (Latin prefix pre-, someone before) describes events that" occur before a planned marriage, as premarital sex, a premarital agreement as to the division of 
(i.e., the largest) of the dinosaurs (etymologically, "king of the tyrant lizards"). Dogs are often named Rex to fool them into thinking they are kings rather· than slaves. And regal （声＇一回）o

formal clothes; Ql', more 
commonly, to the decorations, insignia, or unifonn of a rank, position, office, social club, etc.''The Shriners were dressed in full regalia,"''The five-star general ap-peared in full regalia," etc. 
3._ "madness" of all sorts 

The monomaniac develops an abnormal obsession in respect to one particular thing (Greek monos, _one), but is otherwise nor-mal. The obs邸sionoitself, or the · obsessiveness, is monom叫ao
the adjective is monom叩ia.alo(mon'-a-
m今NI'七bl).Monom皿iacal,olike the adjective forms of various 
other manias, is tricky to pronounce-practice carefully to make 
sure you can say it correctly without

Psychology recognizes other abnormal states, all designating ob-sessions, and built on Greek mania, madness. 
1. dipsomania (dip'今MAY'-nee-a)一morbidecompulsion to keep on absorbing alcoholic beverages (Greek dipsa, thirst). The dipsomaniac has been defined as the person for whom one drink is too many, a thousand not enough. Recent investigations suggest that dipsomania, or alcoholism, may not necessarily be caused by anxieties or frustrations, but possibly by a metabolic or pbysio-logical 
Adjective: dipsomaniacal ( ..... .I'一广…丁"..--^...,.e

2.
kleptomania (klep'－氐MAY'-nee-a)一morbidecompulsion toesteal, not 
from any economic motive, but simply because the mge to talce another's possessions is irresistt'ble. The kleptomaniac (Greek klepte, thief) may be wealthy, and yet be an obsessive shoplifter. The kleptomaniac, for reasons that psychologists are still arguing about, is more often a female than a male, and may pinch her best friend's valueless trinket, or a cheap ashtray or salt shaker from a restaurant, not because she wants, let alone needs, the article, but because she apparently can't help herse]f； she gets earned away. (When she arrives home, she may toss it in a drawer with other loot, and never look at it 

Can you w出ee(and co"ectly pronounce) the adjective? 

3.epyromania (pi'-r>MAY'-ne妇）一morbidecompulsion 
to setefires. Pyromania should not be confused with.incendiarism (in-SEN'-dee－江边gme),ewhich is the malicious and deh"berate burning of another's property, and is not a compulsive need to see the flames and enjoy the thrill of the heat and the smoke. Some 
pyro-maniacs join volunteer fire companies, often heroically putting out the very blazes they themselves have set. An incendiary (in-SEN＇一edee-air-ee)is antisocial, and usually sets fires for revenge. Either of these two dangerous characters is called, colloquially, a "firebug." 

In law, setting fire to anothe六，oreto one's own, property for the purpose of economic gain (such as the collection of the pro-ceeds of an insuraru:e·policy) is called arson (AHR:'一sgn)eand is a felony. The pyromaniac sets fire for the thrill: 
the incendiary for revenge; the arsonist (AHR!-s今nist)efor 
Pyromania is built on Greek”'ITos, fire; incendiar.垃noneLatin incendo. incens匹，toeset.fire; arson on Latin ardo星 
arsus.e
to burn. 


血c?

4.omegalomania (meg仑比MAY'-nee-a)o—morbidodelusionsoof grandeur, power, importance,、 godliness,oetc. Jokes accusing the heads of governments of megalom叩iaoare common. Here's an old chestnut from the forties: 
Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin were talking about their dreams. Churchill: I dreamed last night that God had made me Prime Minister of the whole world. Roosevelt: I dreamed that God had made me 
President of the whole world.o. Stalin: How could you gentlemen have such dreams? J didn't dream of offering you those positions! 


Hitler, Napoleon, and Alexander the Great have been called megalomaniacs-all three certainly had del.ons about thei(in-vincibility. 

Can you write (and pronounce correctly!) the adjective derived h:om megalomaniac? Megalomania is built on Greek me.心， great,obig, large, plus nU叩a.o
to make the so皿do(phone) of his voice greater? 

5.onymphomania (nim＇一丘MAY'-nee心）一morbid,oincessant,o
uncontrollable, and intense desire, on the part of a female, for 
The person? The adjective? 

6.osatyromania (s今teer'+MAY'-ne.)-tbe same morbid, in-cessant, etc. desire on the part of a male.(from Greek satyros, satyr, plus mm血）．

The person? The adjective? 

309 

A satyr (SAY'－血）wasea mythological Greek god, notorious for lechery. He had horns, pointed ears, and the legs of a goat; the rest of him was in human form. Satyromania is also called sat-yriasis (saf-1rRi'今sis).e

4.eand now phobiase
So much for maniacs. There is another side to the coin. Just asepersonality disorders can cause morbid attraction toward certain things or acts (stealing,efire, power, sex, etc.), so also other emo-
_ tional ills can cause violent or morbid repulsions to certain condi-tions, things, or situations. There are people who have irrational and deep-seated dread of cats, dogs, fire, the number thirteen, snakes, thunder or lightning, various colors, and so on almost without end:* Such morbid dread or fear is called, in the language of psychology, a phobia, and we might pause to investigate the three most common ones. These are: 

1. claustrophobia (klaw'一S氐FO'-bee-a)—morbidedread of being physically hemmed in, of enclosed spaces, of crowds, etc. From Latin claustrum, enclosed place, plus Greek phobia, morbid fear. The person: claustrophobe (KLA W'一stra-fob').eAdjective: cl皿strophobice(klaw'一S丘FO'-bik).e
2.eagoraphobia (a't-a-ra-FO'-be心－morbidedread of openespace, the reverse of claustrophobia. People suffering from agora-phobia prefer to stay shut in their homes as much as possible, 


and become panic一strickenein such places as open fields, large pub-lic buildings, airport terminals, etc. From Greek agora, market 


place, plus phobia. The person? The adjective? 
3. acrophobia (ak'-ra-FO'-bee-a)一morbidedread of high places. The victims of this fear will not climb ladders or trees, or stand on tops of furniture. They refuse to go onto the roof of a building or look out the window of one of the higher floors. From Greek akros, highest, plus phobia. 
The person? The adjective?

SESSION 31 

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.ono reverence 

The iconoclast sneers at convention and tradition, attempts tooexpose our cherished beliefs, our revered traditions, or our stereo-typical thinking as shams and myths. H. L. Mencken was the great iconoclast of the 1920s; Tom Wolfe (The Kandy-Kolored Tan-gerine-Flake Streamline Baby), of the 1960s. 
Adolescence is that confused and rebellious time of life in which iconoclasm (I-KON'－吐lar.m)ois quite normal—indeed the adolescent who is not iconoclastic (I-kon勺-KLAST'-ik)oto some degree might be considered either immature or maladjusted. The words from eikon, a religious image, plus klaein, to 
break. Iconoclasare m is not of course restricted to religion. 
2.ois there a God?o
Atheist combines the Greek negative prefix a-with theos, God.oDo not confuse atheism (A Y'一thee-iz-am)owith agnosticism (ag-NOS'－氐siz-am),othe philosophy that claims that God is unknowa-ble, that He may or may not exist, and that human beings can never. come to a final conclusion about Him. The agnostic（啼oNOS'-tik) does not deny the existenc;e of a deity, as does the athe-ist, but simply holds that no proof can be adduced 
one way or the other. 


3. how to know 
Agnostic (which is also an adjective) is built on the Greek rootognostos, known, and the negative prefix a-. An agnostic claims that all but material phenomena is unknown, and, indeed, un-knowable. 
A diagnosis（击ag-No'.sis),oconstructed on the allied Greek 
318 


rootg叩sis,oknowledge, plus dia-, through, is a knowing through examination or testing. A prognosis (prog-NO'-sis), on the other hand, is etymologically a knowing beforehand, hence a prediction, generally, but not solely, as to the course of a disease. (The Greek prefix pro-, before, plus gnosis.) 
Thus, you may say to a doctor: "What's the diagnosis,.Doc?" 
"Diabetes." 
Then you say, "And what's the prognosis?" 
"If you take insulin and watch your diet, you'll soon be as good as new." 
The doctor's prognosis, then, is a forecast of the development or trend of a disease. The doctor knows beforehand, from previ-ous similar cases, what to expect. 
The verb form of diagnosis is· d_iagnose (d巨g-NOS');othe verb form of prognosis is prognosticate {prog-NOS'士氐kayt').oTo use the verb prognosticate correctly, be sure that your meaning in-volves the forecasting of developments from a consideration of symptoms or conditions-whether 
the problem is physical, men-tal, political, economic, psychological, or what have you. 
In school, you doubtless recall taking diagnostic (di'-:ig-NOS'-tik) tests; these measured not what you were supposed to have learned 
during the semester, but your general knowledge in . field, so that your teachers would know what remedial steps to take, just as doctors. rely on their 
diagnosis to decide what drugs or treat-ments to Prescribe. 


In a reading center, various diagnostic machines and tests are used-these tell the clinician what is wrong with a student's read-ing and what measures will probably increase such a student's reading efficiency. 

The medical specialist in diagnosis is a diagnostician (di'-:ig-nos-TISH'-:i
n). 
(prog-nos'－匼KAY'-sh:in).o
The noun form of the verb prognosticate is prognostication 

4.getting back to GodTheos, God, is also found in:

1.oMonotheism (MON'-a-thee-iz-am)一beliefoin one God.o(Monos, one, plus theos, God.) 




Using atheism, atheist, and atheistic as a model, write the word 
The adjective? 

2.ePolytheism (POL'-ee-thee-iz-::,m)一beliefein many gods, asein ancient Greece or Rome. (Polys, many, plus theos.) 
The adjective? . 

3.ePantheism (PAN'-thee-iz-am)一beliefethat God is not ineman's image, but is a combination of all forces of the universe.e
_e
The adjective? 

4.eTheology (thee-OL'仑jee)-theestudy of God and religion.e(Theos plus logos, scie.ce or study.) 
The student is a theologian (thee勺－Lo'一jan),ethe adjective is theological (ther1勺－LOJ'七kal).e

5.eof sex and the tonguee
A lecher practices lechery (LECH'-ar-ee). The derivation iseOld French lechier, to lick. The adjective lecherous (LECH宅eras) has many close or not-so-close synonyms, most of them also, and significantly, starting with the letter l, a sound formed with the tongue, supposedly the seat of sensation. 

1.elibidinous (l今BID'干nas)—fromelibido, pleasure.e
2.elascivious (1千SIV'-ee-as)一fromelascivia, wantonness.e
3.elubricious (l知BRISH'勺S)—fromelubricus, slippery, theesame root found in lubricate. The noun is lubricity (l砬BRIS'-今tee).e

4.elicentious (li-SEN'-shas)—from licere, to be perntltted, theeroot from which we get license, etymologically, "permission," and illicit, etymologically, "not perntltted." 
5.elewd—the previous four words derive from Latin, but thiseone is from Anglo..gaxon lewed, vile. 
6.elustful—from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning pleasure, de-sire. Noun: lust. 

Libidinous, lascivious, lubricious, licentious, lewd, lecherous, lustful are ·seven adjectives that indicate sexual desire and/or ac-tivity. The implication of all seven words is more or less deroga-tory. 


Each adjective becomes a noun with the addition of the noun suffix -ness,-lubricity and lust are alternate noun forms.of two of the adjectives. 

6.eof sex and the itche
Prurient (PR中＇七妇nt),efrom Latin prurio, to itch, to longefor, describes someone who is fi1led with great sexual curiosity, desire, longing, etc. 
Can you form the noun? ___;_.__ 
Pruritis (proor-i'-tis), from the same root, is a medical condi-tion in w血hethe skin is very itchy, but without a rash or erup-tions. (Scratch enough, of course, as you will be irresistibly tempted to do, and something like a rash will soon appear.) The adjective is pruritic (proor-lT'-ik). 
7.eunder and over

Hypochondria（证p今KON'-dree-:i)eis built on two Greekeroots: hypos, under, and chondros, the cartilage of the breast-bone. This may sound farfetched until you realize that under the breastbone is the abdomen; the ancient Greeks believed that mor-bid anxiety about one's health arose in the abdomen-and no one is more m6rbidly, unceasingly, and unhappily anxious about health than the nypochondriac. 
Hypochondriac is also an adjective--an alternate and more commonly used adjective form is hypochondriacal (h子p:i-k:in-DRI'，七1).e

Hypos, under, is a useful root to know. The hypodermic needle penetrates under the skin; a hypothyroid person has an under-working thyroid &land; hypotension is abnormally low blood pres-sure. 






On the other hand, hyper is the Greek root meaning over. The 
hypercritical person is excessively fault-finding; hyperthyroidism is an overworking of the thyroid gland; hypertension is high blood pressure; and you can easily figure out the meanings of hyper-
tensive and

从AGAZINES THAT WILL HELP YOU 

When a pregnant woman takes calcium pills, she must make sure also 
that her diet is rich in vitamin D, since tllis vitamin makes the absorption of the calcium possible. In building your vo-cabulary by learning great quantities of new words, you too must take a c.rtain vitamin, metaphorically speaking, to help you ab-
reading—for jt is in books and mand remember agazinthese es that you wThis words that we have been discussing in these pages. To learn new words without seeing them applied in the context of your reading is to do only half the job and to run the risk of gradually forget-ting the additions to your vocabulary. To combine your vocabu-lary-building with increased reading is to make assurance doubly sure. You are now so alert to the words and roots we have discussed that you will find that most of your reading will be full of the new words you have learned一andeevery time you do see one of the words used in context in a book or magazine, you will understand it more fully and will be taking long steps toward using it yourself.

Brief Intermission Seven 
SOME INTERESTING DERIVATIONS 



Bloomers 

Mrs. Elizabeth Smith Miller invented them in is_49, and showed a working model to a famous women's rights advocate, Amelia J. Bloomer. Amelia was fascinated by the idea of gar-ments that were both modest (they then reached right down to the ankles) and convenient—and promptly sponsored them.... 
Boycott 

Charles C. Boycott was an English land agent who.e difficult duty it was to collect high rents from Irish farmers. In protest, the farmers ostracized him, not even allowing him to make purchases in town or hire workers to harvest his crops. 

Marcel 
Marcel was an ingenious Parisian hairdresser who felt he could improve on the button curls popular in 1875. He did, and made -a fortune. 


337 
Silhouette 
Finance Minister of France just before the Revolution, Etienne de Silhouette advocated the simple life, so that excess money could go into the treasury instead of into luxurious living. And the profile is the simplest form of portraiture, if you get the connec-tion. 


A seventeenth-century English hangman, De"ick by name, hoisted to their death some of the most notorious criminals of the day. 
Sadist 
Because Count de Sade, an eighteenth-century Frenchman, found his greatest delight in torturing friends and mistresses, the term sadist was derived from his name. His works shocked his na-tion and the world by the alanning frankness with which he de-scribed his morbid and bloodthirsty cruelty. 
Galvanism 
Luigi Galvani, the Italian physiologist, found by accident that an electrically charged scalpel could send a frog's corpse into muscu-lar convulsions. Experimenting further, he eventually discovered the principles of chemically produced electricity. His name is re-sponsible not only for the technical expressions galvanism, galva-nized iron, and galvanometer, but also for that highly graphic phrase, "galvanized into action." 

Guppies 
In 1868, R. 1. Lechmere Guppy, president of the Scientific As-sociation of Trinidad, sent some specimens of a tiny tropical fish to the British Museum. Ever since, fish of this species have been called guppies. 



Nicotine 
Four hundred years ago, Jean Nicot, a French ambassador, bought some tobacco seeds from a Flemish trader. Nicot's sue-cessful efforts to popularize the plant in Europe brought him lin-guistic immortality. 

PLACES THAT MADE.OUR LANGUAGE 

Bayonne, France 
Where first was manufactured the daggerlike weapon如at fits over the muzzle end of a rifie--the bayonet. 
Canta!叩o, Italy 
Th. first place in Europe to grow those luscious melons we now call cantaloupes. 
Calicut, India 

The city from which we first imported a kind of cotton cloth now known as calico. 
Tuxedo Park, New York 

In the country club of this exclusive and wealthy community, the short (no tails) dinner coat for men, or t立edo, was popu-larized. 
Egypt 
It was once supposed that the colorful, fortunetelling wan-derers, or Gypsies, hailed from this ancient land. 





Where an elaborately patterned silk, damask, was first made. 
Tzu-t'ing, China Once a great seaport in Fukien Province. Marco Polo called it Zaitun, and in time a silk fabric made there was called satin. 


Frankfurt, Germany 
Where the burghers once greatly enjoyed their smoked beef and pork sausages, which we now ask for in delicatessen stores and su-permarkets by the name of frankfurters, franks, or hot dogs.

SESSION 32 

Words are the symbols of emotions, as well as ideas. You can show your feeling by the tone you use ("You,.re silly" can be an insult, an acc11Sation, or an endearment, depending on how you say it) or by the words you choose 
(you can label a quality either "childish" or "childlike," dep叩dingeon whether you admire it or condemn it-it's the same quality, no matter what you call it). 
In Chapter 11 we discussed ten basic words that you might use to show your disapproval. In this chapter we discuss ten adjectives that indicate wholehearted approval. 

Consider the interesting句peseof people described. in the follow-ing paragraphs, then note how accurately the adjective applies to each type. 

IDEAS 
1.eput the kettle on, 
Pollye
They are friendly, happy, extroverted, and gregarious-the sorteof people who will invite you out for a drink, who like to transact business around the lunch table, who put the coffee to perking as soon as company drops in. They're sociable, genial, cordial, affable一andethey like parties and all the eating and drinking that 
goes with them. 

The adjective is: convivial 


2.eyou can't tire theme

Arnold Bennett once pointed out that we all have the sameeamount of time—twenty-four hours a day. Strictly speaking, that's as inconclusive an observation as Bennett ever made. It's not time 

342 


that counts, but energy—and of that wonderful quality we all have very different amounts, from the persons who wake up tired, no matter how much sleep they've had, to lucky, well-adjusted mor-tals who hardly. ever need to sleep. 
Energy comes from a healthy body, of course; it also comes from a psychological balance, a lack of conflicts and insecurities. 
Some people. apparently have boundless, illimitable energy一 they're on the go from morning to night, and often far into the night, working hard, playing hard, never tiring, never "pooped" or "bushed”一andegetting twice as much done as any three other human beings. 


The adjective is: indefatigable 
3. no tricks, no secretse

They are pleasingly frank, utterly lacking in pretense oreartificiality, in fact quite unable to hide their feelings or thoughts —and so honest and aboveboard that they can scarcely conceive of trickery, chicanery, or dissimulation in anyone. There is, then, a'bout them the simple naturalness and unsophistication of a child. 
The adjcctive is: ingenuous 

4. sharp as a razore

They have minds like steel traps;_ -their insight into problemsethat would confuse or 
mystify people of Jess keenness or discern-ment is just short of amazing. 

The adjective is: perspicacious 

5.eno placating necessarye
They are most generous about forgiving a slight, an insult, aneinjury._ Never do they harbor resentment, store up petty grudges, or waste energy or thought on means of revenge or retaliation. How could they? Thetre much too big-hearted. 
The adjective is: magnanimous 



6. one-person orchestrase
The range of their aptitudes is truly formida.Ie. If they areewriters, they have professional facility in poetry, fiction, biogra-phy, criticism, essays-you just mention it and they've done it, and very competently. H they are musicians, they can play the oboe, the bassoon, the French horn, the bass viol, the piano, the celesta, the xylophone, even the clavichord if you can dig one up. If they are artists, they use oils, water colors, gouache, charcoal, pen and ink一theyecan do anything! Or maybe the range of their abilities cuts across all fields, as in the case of Michelangelo, who was an expert sculptor, painter, poet, architect, and inventor. In case you're thinking "Jack of all tradese...," you're wrong一 they're masters of all trades. 

The adjective is: versatile 
7. no grumbling 

They bear their troubles bravely, never ask for sympathy, never yield to sorrow, never wince at pain. It sounds almost superhu-man, but it's true. 
The adjective is: stoical 
8. na feare
There is not, as the hackneyed phrase has it, a cowardly bone inetheir bodies. They are strangers to fear, they're audacious, daunt-less, contemptuous of danger and hardship. 
The adjective is: intrepid 
9. no dullness 
10.ecity slickerse

They are witty, clever, delightful; and naturally, also, they are brilliant and entertaining conversationalists. 
The adjective is: scintillating 




They are cultivated, poised, tactful, sociaIIy so experienced, so-phisticated, and courteous that they're at home in any group, at ease under all circumstances of social intercourse. You cannot help admiring (perhaps envying) their smoothness and self-as-surance, theirtact and congeniality.

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1.oeat, drink, and be merryo
The Latin verb vivo, to live, and the noun vita, life, are theosource of a number of important English words. 
Convivo is the Latin verb to live together; from this, in Latin, was formed the noun convivium (don't get impatient; we'll be back to English directly), which meant a feast or banquet; and 

r
from convivium we get ouoEnglish word convivial, an adjective that describes the血doof person who likes to attend feasts and banquets, enjoying (and supplying) the jovial good fellowshipcharacteristic of such gatherings: 

Using the suffix -ity can you write the noun form of the adjec-tive convivial?o(Can you pro-nounce it?) 

2.oliving it upo
Among many others, the following English words derive fromoLatin vivo, to live: 
1.ovivacious (vi-V AY'-s加s)-fulloof the joy of living; ani一omated; peppy-avivacio匹 personality.oNoun: vivacity (vi-VAS'-a-tee). You can, as you know, also add -ness to妞yoadjective to form a noun. Write the alternate noun lorm of vivacious: 
2.
vivid一possessingothe freshness of life; strong; sharp-aovivid imagination; a vivid color. Add -ness to form the noun: 

3.orevive (r今VW')一bringoback to life. In the 1960s, men'sofashions of thttwentioes were revived. Noun: revival (ra-VI'-val). 


4.ovivisection (viv'-a-SEK'-shan)--operating on a live animal.o


Sect-is from a Latin verb meaning to cut. Vivisection is the proc-ess of e叩erimentingeon live animals to discover causes and cures of disease. Antivivisectionists object to the procedure, though many of our most important medical discoveries were made through vivisection. 

5. Viviparous (vi-V正'-ar-as)一producingelive babies. Human beings and most other mammals are.viviparous. Viviparous is contrasted to oviparous (o-VIP'.r-as), producing young from eggs. Most fish, fowl, and other lower forms of life are oviparous. 
The 
combining root in both these adjectives is Latin pareo, to give birth (pareni comes from the same root). In oviparous, the first two syllables derive from Latin ovum, egg. 

Ovum, egg, is the source of oval and ovoid, egg-shaped; ovulate 
(O'-vya-layt'), to release an egg from the ovary: ovum (6-vam), the female germ cell which, when fertilized 
by a sperm, develops into an embryo, then into a / etus (FEB＇一tas),eand:6naUy, in about 280 days in the case of humans, is born as an infant. 
The adjective form of ovary is pvarian (o-V,AIR'-ee-an); of fetus, fetal (FEE'-tal). Can you write the noun form of the verb ovulate? 
Love, you may or may not be surprised to hear, also comes from ovum. 
No, not the kind of love you're thinking of. Latin ovum became oeuf in French, or with "the" preceding the noun (the. egg), l'oeuf, pronounced something like LOOF. Zero (picture it for a moment) is shaped like an egg (0), so if your score in tennis is fifteen, and your 
opponent's is zero, you shout triumphantly,
· ·· 
fifteen love! Let's go!" 
3. more about lifee
Latin vita, life, is the origin of: 


1. vital (VI'七l)-essentialeto life; of crucial importance—a vital matter; also full of life, strength, vigor, etc. Add the suffix -ity to form the noun: Add aeverb suffix to-construct the verb:e(meaning: to give Zif e to). Finally, write the noun derived fromethe verb you have constructed:e
2.
Revitalize (ree-Vl'-t今应）isoconstructed from the prefix re-,oagain, back, the root vita, and the verb suffix. Meaningl 










3.oThe prefix de-has a number of meanings, one of which is es-sentially negative, as in defrost, decompose, declassify, etc. Using this prefix, can you write a verb meaning to rob of life, to take life from? Now write the noun form of this verb: 
4.oVitamin-0ne of the many nutritional elements on which lifeois dependent. Good eyesight requires vitamin A (found, for ex-ample, in carrots) ; strong bones need vitamin D (found in sun-light and cod-liver oil); etc. 

Vitalize, revitalize, and devital枷areoused figuratively—for ex-ample, a program or plan is vitali左d,orevitalized, or devitalized, according to how it's handled. 

4.oFrench lifeo
Sometimes, instead of getting our English words directly fromo
,· Latin, we work through one of the Latin-derived or Romance lan-guages. (As you will recall, the Romance languages--French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian-are so called be-cause they were originally dialects of the old Roman tongue. Eng-lish, by the. way, is not a Romance language, but a Teutonic one. Our tongue is a development of a German dialect imposed on the natives of Britain by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes of early Eng-lish history. Though we have taken over into English more than 50 per cent of the Latin vocabulary and almost 30 per cent of the classical Greek vocabulary as roots and prefixes, our basic Ian-guage is nevertheless German). The French, using the same Latin root vivo, to live, formed two expressive phrases much used in English. French pronunciation is, 
of course, tricky, and if you are not at least superficially ac-quainted with that language, your pronunciation may sound a.bit awkward to the sophisticated ear一butotry it anyway. These phrases are: 


1.ojoie de vivre--pronounced something like zhwahd＇
V邸V'（动isid皿ticaloin sound to the s of pleasure). 一 
Literally joy of living, this phrase describes an i.Qunense delight 
in b血g,.alive,oan· effervescent keenness for all the daily activities that human beings indulge in. People who possess j啦devivreoare never moody, depressed, bored, or apathetic--on the -contrary, they are full of sparkle, eager to engage in all group activities, and, most important, always seem to be having a,good time, no matter what they are doing. Joie de vivre is precisely the opposite of ennui (this is also a word of French origin, but is easy to pro-nounce: AHN'-wee), which is a feeling of boredom, discontent, or weariness resulting sometimes from having a jaded, oversophis-
ticated, appetite, sometimes from just finding all of life tedious and unappetizing, and sometimes implying in addition physical lassi-tude and general inactivity. Young children and simple people rarely experience ennui—to them life is always exciting, 
always new. 
2.obon 
pronounced. something like BONG'-vee-VAHNG'.the -NG a muted nasal sound similar to the -ng in sing. 

A bon vivant is a person who lives luxuriously, especially in re-spect to rich food, good liquor, expensive theater parties, operas, and other accouterments of upper-class life. Bon vivant means, lit-erally, a good liver,· actually, a high liver, one who lives -a Juxuri一oous life. W证noyou think of a bon vivant {usually, language being sexist, a male), you get the picture of someone atti比dinotop hat, "soup and fish" or tuxedo, raising his cane to call a taxi while a beautiful, evening.gowned and sophisticated-looking woman, spar-kling in diamonds and furs, waits at his side. They're going to· a champagne and partridge supper at an outrageously expensive res-taurant, etc.-fill in your own details of the high life. 
The bon vivant is of course a convivial person一andoalso likely to be a gourmet (goor-MAY'), another word from French. 
5, food and how to enjoy it 

The gourmand (GOOR'-m:ind) enjoys food with a sensual pleasure. To gourmands the high spots of the day are the times for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight supper; in short, they like 







to eat, but the eating must be good. The verb form, gormandize (GAWR'-man-diz'), however, has suffered a degeneration in meaning-it signifies to stuff oneself Uke a pig. 
Agour血indeis significantly different from a gourmet, who has also a keen interest in food and liquor, but is much more fastidi-ous, is more of a connoisseur, has a most discerning palate for delicate tastes, flavors, and di行erences;egoes in for rare delicacies (like hummingbirds'etongues and other such absurdities) ; and approaches山eewhole business from a scientific, as well as a sen-sual, viewpoint. Gourmet is always a complimentary term, gour-mand somewhat less so. 
The person who eats voraciously, with no discernment what-ever, but merely for the purpose of stuffing himself ("I know I haven't had enough to eat till I feel sick"), is called a glutton (GLUT'勺n)--obviouslyea highly derogatory term. The verb glut-Ionize is stronger than gormandize; the adjective gluttonous_ (GLUT＇一:i-nas)eis about the strongest epithet you can apply to someone whose voracious eating habits you find repulsive. Some-one who has a voracious, insatiable appetite for money, 
sex, pun-ishment, etc. is also called a glutton.

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.. no fatigue 

Indefatigable is derived form of fatigue-in-is a negative prefix, the suffix -abla e means able to be; hence, literally, indefat-igable means unable to be fatigued. The noun is切defatiegability (in'-da-fat'-Q-g今BIL'七tee).e
2.ehow simple can one be?e

Ingenuous is 
a complimentary term, though its synonyms吨ve,egullible, and credulous are faintly derogatory. To call people inge.uous implies that they are frank, open, art-less-in other words, not likely to try to put anything over on 
you, nor apt to hicle feelings or tboughts that more sophisticated persons would consider it wise, tactful, or expedient to conceal. 
Ingenuous should not be confused with ingenio四 (in-JEEN'-yas)一noteethe slight difference in spelling—which on the con-trary means shrewd, clever, inventive. 
The noun form of ingenuous is ingenuousness; of ingenious, in-genuity (in'-ja-N仅Y-a-teee)eor ingeniousness. 
To call people血ivee(nah-EEV') is to imply that they have not learned the ways of the world, and are therefore idealistic and trusting beyond the point of safety; such idealism and trust have probably come from ignorance or. inexperience. · The noun is 吨vetee(nab-eev-TAY'). 

Credulous (KREJ'-a七s)eimplies a willingness to believe almost anything, no matter how fantastic. Credulity (k.J改＇－la-tee),elike naivete, usually results, again; from ignorance or inexpe-rience, or perhaps from an inability to believe that human beings are capable of lying. 
Gullible (GUL'-a-bal) means如silyetricked, easily fooled, eas一



ily imposed on. It is a stronger word than credulous and is more derogatory. Gullibility (gul宅BIL'-a-tee)eresults more from stu.: pidity than from ignorance or inexperience. 
These four synonyms, ingenuous, naive, credulous, and gullible, are fairly close, but they contain areas of distinction worth remembering. Let's review them: 
1. ingenuous—frank, not given to concealment 
2.enaive—inexperienced, unsophisticated, trusting 
3. credulous-willing to believe; not suspicious or skeptical 

4. gullible-easily trickede




3.ebelief qnd disbelief 


Credulous comes from Latin credo, to believe, the same root found in credit (if people believe in your honesty, they will. extend credit to you; they will credit what you say). -Ous is an adjective suffix that usually signifies full of. So, strictly, credulous means full of believingness. 

Do not confuse credulous with credible. (KRED'-a-b.11). In the latter word we see combined the root credo, believe, with -ible, a suffix meaning can be. Something credible can be beiieved. 


Let's chart some differences: 

Credulous listeners一thoseewho fully believe what they hear A credible story-one that can be believede'-An incredulous (in-KREJ'今fas)eattitude—an attitude of skep-
ticism, of non-belief An incredible (in-KRED宅b.11)estory—one that cannot be believed Incredible characters-persons who are so unique that you can scarcely believe they exist. 
Nouns are formed as follows: 
credulous--credulity (kra-J心－片tee)eincredulous-incredulity (in-kr今JOO＇一la-tee)ecredible--credibility (kred'-a-BIL'-a-tee) incredible-incredibility (in-kred'-a-BIL'-a-tee) 
To check your understanding of these distinctions, try the next test.

4.owhat people believe ino
Credo, to believe, is the origin of four other useful Englishowords. 


1. Credo (KR.EE＇一do)一personalebelief, code of ethics; the principles by which people guide their actions. 
2.eCreed-aeclose synonym of credo; in addition, a religiousebelief, such_ as Catholicism, Judaism, Protestantism, Hinduism, etc. 
3.eCredence (KREE'一如ns)一beli忒，eas in, "I place no ere-dence in his stories." or "Why should I give any credence to what you say?" 
4.eCredentials (m-DEN'-shals)一aedocument or documentseproving a person's right to a title or privilege (i.e., a right to be believed), as in, "The new ambassador presented his credentials to the State Department." 
5.eheads and tailse

We can hardly close our book on the words suggested by ingen-uous without looking at-tl1e other side of the coin. If ingenuous means frank, open, then disingenuous (dis-in-JEN'-y的心s)eshould mean not frank or open. But disingenuous people are far more 
than simply not ingenuous. They are crafty, cunning, dishonest, artful, insincere, untrustworthy—and they are all of these while making a pretense of being simple, frank, and aboveboard. You are thinking of a wolf in sheep's clothing? It's a good analogy. Similarly, a remark may be disingenuous, as may also a state-ment, an attitude, a confession, etc. Add -ness to form the noun derived from disingenuous:

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 

1.ehow to.look 

The Latin root specto, to look, is the source of a host of com-mon English words: spectacle, spectator, inspect, retrospect (a looking back), prospect (a looking ahead), etc. In a variant spelling, spic-, the root is found in conspicuous (easily seen or looked at), perspicacious, and perspicuous. 
A perspicacious (pur'哥均－KAY'-shas)eperson is keen-minded, mentally sharp, astute. Per-
is a prefix meaning through; so the word etymologically means looking through (matters, etc! ) keenly, intelligently. The noun:. perspicacity {pur'-sp今KAS'一千etee). Write an alternate noun ending.. ine

Perspicacity is a synonym of acumen（今KYOO＇.m:in),emental keenness, sharpness, quickness; keen insight. The root is Latin acuo, to sharpen. 
2.esharpness 
From acuo, to sharpen, come such words as acute, sharp, sud-den, as acute pain, an acute attack of appendicitis, acute reason-ing, etc; and acupuncture (AK'-y砬punk'-cbar),ethe insertion of a (sharp) needle into the body for medical purposes. The noun form of acute, referring to the mind or thinking, is acuteness or acuity（今KY改注tee);ein other contexts, acuteness only. 
Acupuncture combines acuo, to sharpen, with punctus, point. When you punctuate a. sentence, you put various points (periods, com.mas, 
etc.) where needed; when lightning punctuates the storm, or when the silence is punctuated by the wailing of police 





sirens, again points, etymologically speaking, interrupt the atmos-
phere, the quiet, etc. 
If you are punct皿l,eyou're right on the point of time (noun: 
punct血lity); if you're punctilious (punk-兀L'心心s),eyou are 
exact, scrupulous, very careful to observe the proper points of be-
havior, procedure, etc. (noun: punctiliousness). And to puncture 
something, of course, is to make a hole in it with a sharp point一 
as to puncture someone's tire, or figuratively, illusions, fantasies, 
or ego. Pungent (PUN'-jant) comes from another form of the 
root punctus (pungo, to pierce sharply), so a pungent smell or 
taste is sharp, spicy, pricking the nose or taste buds, so to speak; 
and a pungent wit sharply pierces one's sense of humor. Can you 
write the noun forms of this adjective? 
or 
3.esome more lookinge
Perspicacious should not be confused with perspicuous (p企 
SPIK'-yoo..gs). Here is the important distinction: 
Perspicacious means smart, sharp, able to look through and un-
derstand quickly. This adjective applies to persons, their reason-
ing, minds, etc. 
Perspicuous is the obverse side of the coin—it means easily un-
derstood from one look, and applies to writing, style, books, and 
like things that have to be understood. Hence it is a synonym of 
clear, simple, lucid. H you write with perspicuous style, your Ian-
guage is clear, easy to understand. If you are perspicacious, you 
understand quickly, easily. 
The noun form of perspicuous is perspicui句(pur-spQ-KYOO＇一e
a-tee), or, of course, perspicuousness. 
A spectacle is something to look at; spectacles (eyeglasses) are the means by which you get a comfortable and accurate look at , the world. Anything spectacular is, etymologically, worth looking 
at. 
A spectator is one who looks at what's happening. 
To inspect is to look into something. 
Retrospect (RET'干哼ekt')eis a backward look一generallyethe 
word is preceded by the preposition in, for instance, "His life in 
retrospect seemed dreary and dnll," or''Most experiences seeme
_e




more enjoyable in retrospect than in actuality" (retro-, back-ward). 
Prospect (PROS'-pekt') is a forward look,· prospective (p飞 SPEK'-tiv) is the adjective. What's the prospect for inflation, for world peace, for the domestic energy supply? Your prospective mother-in-law is the one you.can look forward to if you marry a certain person; similarly, your prospective bride, groom, child, job, vacation, etc. is the person, thing, or activity in the future that you look forward to. (The prefix is pro-, forward, ahead, before.) 

If you enjoy looking at yourself, figuratively speaking, then you like to examine your mental processes and emotional reactions, in the intense way characteristic of the introvert (see Chapter 3). Your mind's eye turns inward, and you spend a good deal of time analyzing yourself, your character, your personality, your actions. Hence, since you look inward, you are introspective (in'-tr今 SPEK'-tiv)-tbe prefix is intro-, inside, within. If you introspect (in'-trQ-SPEKT'), you look inward and examine your inner reac-tions. Too much introspection (in'-t心PEK'-sh如）orointrospec-tiveness may lead to unhappiness or to depressing thoughts or feelings of anxiety一fewopeople have the. courage to see them-selves as they really are. 
There are times when you have to look around most carefully; you must then be circumspect (SUR'.kQm-spekt')—:watchful, 
cautious, alert (circum-, around). The 
noun is circumspection (sur'-kem-SPEK'-sh叩）orocir-cumspectness. 


If something looks good or sensible, but actually is not, we call it specious (SPEE'-sbQs). A specious argument sounds plausible, but in reality is based on an error, a fallacy, or an untruth. The

ORIGINS AND R曰ATEDoWORDS 


1.othe great and the smallo
You are familiar with Latin animus, mind. Anim匹 andoa re-lated root, anima, life principle, soul, spirit (in a sense, these meanings are all very similar), are the source of such words as an-加al,oanimate and inanimate, animated, and animation: knowing the meaning of the roots, you have a better understanding of any word built on them. 
Magnanimo匹 contains,oin addition to animus, mind, the root magnus, large, great, which you recall. from m哩记loquent.oM呤 nanimo匹 peopleohave such great, noble minds or souls that they are beyond seeking petty revenge. 

Theonounoism鸣叩冗切认y(ma旷－n今NIM心＇tee).o


On the other hand, people who have tiny, tiny minds or souls are pusillanimo四 (py.'-sa-LAN'勺－mes)一Latinp血llus,otiny. Hence,.血yoare contemptibly petty and mean. The noun is p血llan加切(poy的＇－＄如NIM＇今tee).o

Other words built on anim匹， mind:o
1.ounanimo匹 (y砬NAN'令血s)--ofoone mind. If the Su-preme Court hands down a unanimous opinion, all the judges are ofone mind (Latin un匹， one).oThe noun is unanim切(y仅'-na-NIM＇一今tee).
2.
equanimi句（ee＇－kwg..NIM＇今teeoor ek'-wa-NIM屯ee)一 etymologically, "equal (or balanced) mind." Hence, evenness or calm,ness of血d;composure．丑youopreserve your equanimity under trying circumstances, you keep your temper, you do not get confused, you remain calm (Latin aequ匹， equal).o

3.oanimus (AN＇今叩s)一hostility,oill will, malevolence. Ety-mologically, a汕血sois simply mind, but has degenerated, as words often do, to mean unfriendly mind. The word is most often used in a pattern like, "I bear you no anim匹， evenothough you have tried to destroy me." (Such a s巨tementshows real magnanimi切）
4.
animosi句（an＇.MOS＇今tee)-il1owill, hostility. An exactosynonym of a汕皿s,oand a more common word. It is used in pat-terns like, "You feel a good deal of animosi仅don'otoyou?", "There is real animo出yobetween Bill and Ernie," "H you bear me noanima出y,owhy do you treat me so badly?'' 





2.oturningo
Versatile comes from verto, vei
皿s,oto turn一versatileopeopleocan tum their hand to many things successfully. The noun 
is ver-satili句(wr'-sa-TIL＇仑tee).o
3.oZeno and the front porcho


Centuries ago, in ancient Greece, the philosopher Zeno lecturedoon a topic that still piques the human m血，toowit: "How to Live a Happy Life." Zeno would stand on a porch (the Greek word for which is stoa) and hold forth somewhat as·follows: people should free themselves from intense emotion, be unmoved by both joy 









373 
and sorrow, and submit without complaint to unavoidable neces-sity. 
Today, psychologists suggest pretty much the exact opposite--let your emotions flow freely, express your love or animosity, don't bottle up your feelings. But in the fourth century B.c., when Zeno was expounding his credo, his philosophy of control of the passions fell on receptive ears. His followers were called Stoics, after the stoa, or porch, from w出chothe master lectured. 
If we call people stoical, we mean that they bear their pain or sorrow without complaint, they meet adversity with unflinching fortitude. This sounds very noble, you w讥admit—actually,oac-cording to modem psychological belief, it is healthier not to be so stoical. Stoicism (STO'仑siz-:im)omay be an admirable virtue (mainly because we do not then have to listen to the stoic's trou-bles), but it can be overdone. 

4.ofear and tremblingo
Intrepid is from Latin trepido, to tremble. Intrepid people ex-hibit courage and fearlessness (and not a single tremble!) when confronted by dangers from which you and I would run lice the 
cowards we are. (You recognize the negative prefix in-.) The noun: intrepidity· (in'－氐PID'七tee),or, of course,证olrepidness. Trepido is the source also of trepidation (trep'-a-DAY'-sban) -great fear, trembling, or alarm.o


5.oquick flasho
Scintilla, in Latin, is a quick, bright spark; in English the wordo
scintilla (sin-TIL勺）mayoalso mean a spark, but more commonly 

refers to a very small particle (which, in a sense, a spark is), as 
in, "There was not a scintilla of evidence against him." 
In the verb scintillate (SIN＇一氐Iayt'),othe idea of the spark 
remains; someone who scintillates sparkles with charm and wit, 
flashes brightly with humor; The noun is scintillation (sin'一tQ
LAY'-sh叩）．






6.ecity and countrye

People who live in the big city go 
to theaters, attend the opera,evisit .useutns and picture galleries, browse in bookstores, and shop at Rob'inson's, Bloo呻1gdale's,eMarshall Field, or other large department stores. 
These activities fill them with culture and sophistication. 
Also, they crowd into jammed subway trains or· buses, squeeze into packed elevators, cross the street in competition with high-powered motorcars, patiently stand in line outside of movie houses, and then wait again in the lobby for seats to be vacated. 
Also, they have the.privilege of spending two hours a day.going to and coming from work. 

As a result, city-dwellers are refined, polished, courteous一扛SOethe etymology of urbane (from Latin urbs, city) tells us. (And you must be absurdly credulous, if not downright gulhole, to be-廿eveeit.) The noun is urbanity (ur-BAN'-::i-tee). 

So urbane people are 
gracious, affable, cultivated, suave, tactful 一addeany similar adjectives you can think of. 
Urban (UR凇n)eas an adjec廿veesimply refers to· cities-urban affairs, urban areas, urban populations, urban life, urban develop-
ment, etc. 

Consider some prefixes: sub-, near; inter-, between; intra-; in-side, within; ex-, out. Acid each prefix to the root urbs, using the adjective suffix -an: sub : near the city 


between cities : within a city e out of the city 
The suburbs residential sections, or small communities, close to a large cityare ; Larchmont is a suburb of New York City, Whittier a suburb of Los Angeles. Suburbia (s今BUR.'-bee-a)emay designate suburbs as a group; suburban residents, or suburbanites (s今BUR.'-b今nits'),eas a 







group; or the typical manners, modes of living, customs, etc. of suburban residents. An interurban bus travels between cities, an intraurban bus within a single city. 
n
Aeexurb (EKS'-urb) lies well beyond, way outside, a large city, and generally refers to a region inhabited by well-to-do families. Exurb has derived forms corresponding to those of sub-urb. Can you construct them? 
Plural noun: Adjective: Resident: As a group; manners, customs, etc.: 



Urbs is the city; Latin rus, ruris is the country, i.e., farmland, fields, etc. So rural (R心R'-al)erefers to country or farm regions, agriculture, etc.-awealthy rural area. 
Rustic (RUS'-tik) adjective 
may describe furniture or dwellings made of roughas hewan n wood, or furnishings suitable to a farmhouse; or, when applied to a person, is an antonym of urbane -unsophisticated, boorish, lacking in劝cialegraces, uncultured.eNoun: rusticity (rus-TIS'-:i-tee). Rustic is also a noun designatingea person with such characteristics, as in, "He was considered a心ticeby his classmates, · all of whom 
came from cultured andewealthy backgrounds."eUrbane and rustic, when applied to people, are emotionally charged words. Urbane is complimentary, rustic derogatory.* To rusticate (RUS'－氐kayt')eis to spend time in the country, away from the turmoil and tensions of big-city life. Can you con-struct the noun? 
*eIncidentally, a word used with a derogatory connotation (bitch, piggish, gl11tton, idiot, etc.) is called a pejorative (pe-JAWR'一千tiv).ePejorative isealso an adjective, as in,''She spoke in pejorative terms about her岱hus-band." The derivation is Latin pejor, worse.e

WORDS INFLUENCE YO,lJR THINKING 
By now, you have thoroughly explored hundreds upon hun-dreds of valuable words and scores upon scores of important Greek and Latin roots. 
As you went along you stopped at frequent intervals to say aloud, think about, work with, and recall the words you were add-ing to your vocabulary. 
By now, therefore, the words you have been learning are proba-bly old friends of yours; they have started to influence your think-ing, have perhaps begun to appear in your conversation, and have certainly become conspicuous in your reading. In short, they have been effective in making changes in your intellectual climate. 
Let us pause now for another checkup of the success of your study. In the next chapter, you will find a second Comprehensive Test. Take the test cold if you feel that ail the material is at your fingertips; or .pend a little time reviewing Chapters 9, 10; 11, and 12 if you believe such review is necessary.

SESSION 39 

This world, Robert Louis Stevenson once claimed-with, I thhtk, questionable logic-is so full of a number of things that we should all be as happy as kings. 
I doubt very strongly that happiness comes from the outside, or that kings are necessarily happy. But I will go this far (and no further) with Stevenson: the world is certainly full of a number of things. For instance, poverty and misery, hospitals and insane asy-lums, slums and racial restrictions, cut-down forests and once fer-tile lands becom迪progressivelysmore arid, war and death and taxes and bumbling diplomats. I know that Stevenson had a different sort of thing in mind, for romantic poets tend to view the world through rose-tinted spectacles, but it is often necessary to counter one extreme with another-and I simply wish to set the record straight. 
In this chapter we are going to discuss a number of things to be found in the world and in the minds of its inhabitants—poverty and wealth; secondhand emotions; the relativity of time; praise of various sorts; small talk and how to indulge in it; animals; long-ings for the past; sounds; eating habits; and many kinds and con-ditions of secrecy. 
As you see, when you start exploring ideas, as we constantly do iJ1 these chapters, you never know what will turn up. 
IDEAS 

1.sfor want of the green stuffs
There are those people who are forced (often through no faultsof their own) to pursue an existence not only devoid of such Iuxu-ries as radios, television sets, sunken bathtubs, electric orange-juice squeezers, automobiles, Jacuzzis, private swinuning pools, 




sufficient,food, heated homes, hot water, vermin-and rodent-free surroundings, decent clothing, etc. Such people live: 

in penury 
2.e
at least watch it.e


All normal people want and need love and at least a modicumeof excitement in their lives一soesay the psychologists. If no one loves them, and if they can find no one on whom to lavish their own love, they may often satisfy their · emotional longings and needs by getting their feelings secondhand—through reading love stories, attending motion pictur.s, watching soap operas, etc. 

vicarious feelings 
These are: 


During the late winter and early spring of 1948-49, great num-hers of people went practically berserk joining and forming "pyra-mid clubs." li you have not heard :of this amazing phenomenon, I won't attempt to describe it in any of its multifarious ramifica-tions, but the main point was that you paid two dollars, treated some people to coffee and dou咖uts,eand shortly thereafter (if you were gullible enough to fall for this get-rich-quick scheme) supposedly received a return of some fantastic amount like $2,064 for your investment. 

For a short time, pyramid clubs were a rage--soon they had vanished from the American scene. 
Anything that lasts for but a. short time and leaves no trace is: 


4.ehow not to call. a spade...e


Words are only symbols of things-they are not the thingsethemselves. (This, by the way, is one of the basic tenets of seman-





tics.) But many people identify the w.rd and the thing so closely that they fear to use certain words that symbolize things that are unpleasant to the皿e
I know that this is confusing, so let me illustrate. Words having to do with death, sex, certain portions of the anatomy, excretion, etc. are avoided by certain people. 

These people prefer circumlocutions—words that "talk around" an idea or that mean or imply something but don't come right out and say so directly. 
For example: WORD CIRCUMLOCUTION die expire; depart this life; pass away; leave this vale of tears sexual intercourse (intimate) relations; "playing house"; "shacking up" prostitute lady of the evening顶Ileede ioie; painted woman; lady of easy virtue; fille de nuit,· streetwalker;.hooker house of prostitution house of ill-fame; bawdyhouse; house of ill-repute; bagnio; brothel; 


bordello;''house"; "massage parlor' buttocks, behind derriere; rear end; butt; tail breasts bosom; bust; curves toilet 
powder room; little girl's room; 
facilities; washroom; lavatory; head The left:handecolumn is the. direct, non-pussyfooting word. The 
如

euphemisms

"Whenever I'm in the dumps, I get a new suit."e"Oh, so that's where you get them!"e"Lend me a dime一Iewant to phone one of my friends." 

"Here's a quarter--call them,all." "The doctor says I have snoo in my blood!" 




"Snoo? What's snoo?" 
"Not a darn! What's new with you?" 
"What are twins?" 
"Okayi what are twins?" 
"Womb mates!" 

·e"I took a twip yesterday."e
"A twip?"e

"Yes, I took a twip on a twain!"e
These are examples of:e

7. good old dayse
Do you sometimes experience a keen,. almost physical, longingefor associations or places of the past? 

When you pass the neighborhood in which you were born and where you spent yo缸 earlyeyears, do you have a sharp, strange re-action, almost akin to mild nausea? 

When you are away from home and friends and family, do pleasant remembrances crowd in on your mind to the point where your present loneliness becomes almost unbea戊ble,eand you actu-
ally feel a little sick? 
This common feeling is called:

There are certain things most of us do in private, like taking aebath. Some people like'to engage in. other activities in complete privacy--eating, reading, watching TV, sleeping, for example.

SESSION 40 


ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.emoney, and what it will buy 


The modern world operates largely by means of a price struc-ture--wealth and poverty are therefore words that indicate the 

possession, on the one hand, or the lack, on the other, of money. Penury, from Latin penuria, need, neediness, is dire, abject pov-erty, complete lack of financial resources. It is one of the two strongest English words there are to denote absence of money. The adjective form, penurious（产NYO't>r'-ee心seor p千N叩R'eee心s),estrangely enough, may mean poverty-stricken, but more commonly signifies stingy, close-fisted, niggardly; so sparing in the use of money as to give the appearance of penury. 
Penurious is a synonym of parsimonious (pahr'一s:i--M妇ee-:is), but is much stronger in implication. A parsimonious person is stingy; a penurious person is twice as stingy. Penury, then, is pov-erty; penuriousness is stinginess, excessive frugality. l'he noun form of parsimonious is parsimony (PAHR'-s:i-mo'-nee). 
A somewhat milder word than penury for poverty (if you can imagine a mild degree of poverty) is indigence_ (IN＇如－j:ins).eIn-digent (IN＇一如j:int)epeople are not absolutely penniless-they are simply living in reduced circumstances, forgoing many creature comforts, forced to undergo the type of hardships that may ac-company a lack of sufficient funds. 
On the other hand, a close synonym of penury, and one of equal strength, is destitution (des'－氐T叹Y-sh叩）．eDestitutee(DES'－氐t.t)epeople do not even have the means for mere subsistence--as such, they are perhaps on the verge of starvation. Penu,y and, destitution are not merely straitened ciI'Cum-stances—they are downright desperate circumstances. 
To turn now to the brighter side of the picture, the possession of money, especially in increasing amounts, is expressed by affluence (AF'-1砬叩s).eAffluent (AF'-1砬:int)epeople, people of affluence, or those living in a/JIuent circumstances, are more than comfortable; in addition, there is the implication that their wealth is increasing. People who live in affluence probably own large and costly homes, run big, new cars, belong to expensive golf or country clubs, etc. 
A much stronger term is opulence (OP'-y今fans),ewhich not only implies much greater wealth than affluence, but in addition suggests lavish expenditures and ostentatiously luxurious sur-roundings. People of opulence own estates; drive only outra-geously expensive and specially equipped cars (Rolls-Royces, Mercedes-Benzes, Porsches, etc.); have a corps of servants, in-





eluding major-domo; belong to golf and yacht and country clubs, etc.a , etc. Embroider 
the fantasy as much as you wish to. Opulent (OP'-ya-font) may describe 
people, surroundings, styles of life, or the like. 
· 

Affluent is a combination of the prefix ad-, to, toward (chang-ing to af-before a root beginning with f), plus the Latin verb fluo, to flow--affluence is that delightful condition in which money keeps flowi.g to us,. and no one ever turns off the spigot. Other 
·
words from theosame root, fluo, flow, fluid, influence, confluence (a "flowing together"), to fluent (are the words flow smoothly), etc. Opulent is from Latin opulentus, wealthy. No other English words derive from this root. 
2. doing and feelingo

If you watch a furious athletic event, and you get tired, thoughothe athletes expend all the energy-that's vicarious fatigue. 
If your friend goes on a bender, and as you watch him absorb one drink after another, you begin to feel giddy and stimulated, that's vicarious intoxication. 
If you watch a mother in a motion picture or dramatic play suffer horribly at the death of her child, and you go through the same agony, that's vicarious tonnent. 
You can experience an emotion, then, in two ways: firsthand, through actual participation; or vicariously, by becoming em.; . pathetically involved in another person's feelings. 
Some people, for example, lead essentially dull and colorless Iiyes. Through their childre兀throughoreading or attending the theater, however, they can experience all the emotions felt by others whose lives move along at a swift, exciting pace. These people Jive at second hand; they live vicariously. 
3.otime is relativeo

Elephants and turtles live almost forever; human beings in theoUnited States have a life expectancy in general of sixty-eight to seventy-six years (though the gradual conquest of disease is con. 
411 










stantly lengthening our span);t dogs live from seven to ten years; and some insects exist for only a few hours or days. 
One such short-lived creature is the dayfly, which in Greek was called ephemera. Hence anything so short-lived, so unenduring that it scarcely seems to outlast the day, may be called ephemeral. 
A synonym of ephemeral is evanescent (ev-.NES'-ant), fleet-ing, staying for a remarkably short time
, vanishing. Something intangible, like a feeling, may be called evanescent; it's here, and before you can quite comprehend it, it's gone--vanished. 
The noun is evanescence (ev'-a-NES'-ans) ; the verb is to evanesce (ev仑NBS').oEvanescent is built on the prefix e-(ex-), out, the root vanesco, to vanish, and the adjective suffix -ent. The suffix -esce often, but not always, means begin to. -Escent may mean becoming or beginning to. Thus: 

adolescent-beginning to grow up; 
beginning to become an adult 
evanesce-begin to vanish 
convalesce-begin to get well after illness 
putrescent一beginningoto roto; 
beginning to become putrid 
obsolescent一becomingoobsolete 


4. an exploration of various good things 

A euphemism is a word or expression that has been substituted for anoilier that is likely to offend一itois built on the Greek prefix eu:., good, the root pheme, voice, and the noun suffix -ism.(Etymo-logically, "something said in a good voice!") Adjective: eu-phemistic (y氓＇一位MIS'-tik)o

Other English words constructed from the prefix eu-: 
l.oeuphony (YOO'一记nee)—goodosound; pleasant lilt ororhythm (phone, sound) 

Adjective: euphonic (y仅.-FON'-ik)oor euphonious (y仅>-FO'-nee-;,s) 

t Latest figures, 1978, for the United States: males, 68.5 years; females,
76.4 years. 



2.aeulogy 
(Y.'-la-jee)—etymologically, "good speech"; a formal speech of· praise, usually delivered a funeral oration. 
Logos in this term means word or speech, as as it did in philology (Chapter 6). Logos more commonly means science or study, but has the alternate meaning in eulogy, philology, monologue, dia-logue, epilogue (words upon the other words, or "after-words"), and prologue (words before .he main part, "before-words," or introduction). 


Adjective: euloglsti,: (y砬片JIS'一tik);averb: eulogize (YOO-la-j记）；personawho delivers a eulogy: eulogist (YOO-Ia-jist) 
3. euphoria (y砬FAWR'-ee-a)一名oodafeeling, a sense of men-
tal buoyancy and physical well-being Adjective: euphori,: (y.-FAWR'-ik) 

4. euthanasia (y.勺匼NAY'-zha)--etymologically,a"good death"; method of painless death inflicted on people suffering from incurable diseases-not legal at the present time, but ad-vacated by many people. The word derives from eu-plus Greek thanatos, death. 
5.aexploration of modes of expression 
Badinage is a half-teasing, non-malicious, frivolous banter,_ in-tended to amuse rather than wound. Badinage· has a close syno-nym, persiflage (PUR'-s今flahzh'),awhich is a little more derisive, a trifle more indicative of contempt or mockery-but stJ.11 totally unmalicious. 

In line with badinage and persiflage, there are four other forms of expression you should be familiar with: cliche (klee-SHAY'), bromide (BRO'－血d'),aplatitude (PLAT'－:;i-t.d), and anodyne (AN'－今a面）．a
A cliche is a pattern of words which was once new and fresh, but which now is so old, worn, and threadbare that only banal, unimaginative speakers and writers ever use it. Examples are: fast and furious,· unsung heroes,· by leaps and bounds; conspicuous by its absence; green with envy,· etc. The most devastating criticism you can make of a piece of writing is to say, "It is full of clich纣＇；athe most pointed insult to a person's way of talking is,''Youspeak in clich釭"



A bromide is any trite, dull, and probably fallacious remark that shows little evidence of original thinking, and that therefore convinces a listener of the total absence of_perspicacity on the part of the speaker. 
For instance, some cautious, dull-minded individual might warn you not to talce a chance in these words: "Remember it's better to be safe than sorry!" 
Your sneering response might be: "Oh, that old bromide尸e
A platitude is similar to a clichior bromide, in that it is a dull, trite, hackneyed, unimaginative pattern of words-but, to add in-sult to injury (cliche), the spealcer uses it with an air of novelty一eas if he just made it up, and isn't he the brilliant fellow! 
An anodyne, in the medical sense, is a drug that allays pain without curing an illhess, lilce aspirin or morphine. Figuratively, an anodyne is a statement made to allay someone's fears or anxie-ties, not believed by the speaker, but intended to be believed by the listener. "Prosperity is just around the comer" was a popular anodyne of the 1930s. 
A bromide is also a drug, formerly used as a sedative. Sedatives dull the senses-the statement labeled a bromide comes from a speaker of dull wit and has a sedative effect on the listener. The adjective is bromidic (br吐MID'-ik),eas in "his bromidic way of 
_ expressing himself." Platitude derives from Greek platys, broad or flat, plus the noun suffix -tude. Words like plateau (flat land), plate and platter (flat dishes), and platypus (flat foot) all derive from the same root as platitude, a flat statement, i.e., one that falls flat, despite the speaker's high hopes for it. The adjective is platitudinous (plat'-a-TOO-d今n忑），asein, "What a platitudinous remark." Anodyne is a combination of the negative prefix an-with Greek odyne, pain. Anodynes, as drugs, lessen pain; as statements, they are intended to reduce or eliminate emotional pain or arutiety.

SESSION 41 

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1.epeople are the craziest animalse

Bovine, placid like a cow, stolid, patient, unexcitable; is built onethe Latin word for ox or cow, bovis, plus the suffix -ine, like, simi-lar to, or characteristic of. To call someone bovine is of course far from complimentary, for this adjective is considerably stronger than phleg血tic,e
and implies a certain mild contempt on the part of the speaker. Abo咖eeperson is somewhat like a vegetable: eats and grows and lives, but apparently is lacking in any strong feel-ings. 






1.eleonine (LEE＇七nin')-likeea lion in appearance or temper-ament. 
2.ecanine (KAY'，面）一likeea dog. As a noun, the ·word referseto the species to which dogs belong. Our c血ineeteeth are similar to由oseeof a dog. 





421 

3.afeline (FEE＇一rm，）-catlike.aWe may speak of feline grace;aor (insultingly) of feline temperament when we mean that a per-son is''catty." 
4.aporcine (PAWR'一Sin')一piglike.a
5.avulpine (V切::-pin'）—foxlikeain appearance or tempera-ment. When applied to people, this adjective usually indicates the shrewdness of a fox. 
6.aursine (UR'一sin'）一bearlike.a
7.alupine (LOO＇一pin)一wolflike.a

8.aequine (EE'-kwin')-horselike; "horsy."a
9.apiscine (PIS'-in')-fishlike.a

All these adjectives come from the corresponding Latin wordsafor· the animals; and, of course, each adjective also describes, or refers to, the specific animal as well as to the person lilcened to the 
animal.  
 
1.aleoa lion  
2.acanisa3.afelisa dog cat  

 4.aporcus 5.a·vulpus 6.aursusa pigfoxabear  
7.alupusa8.aequusa9, piscisa wolf horse fish  


The word for meat from a pig-pork--derives, obviously, from porcus. Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the Great Bear and the Lit-tie Bear, the two conspicuous groups of stars in the north江nasky(conspicuous, of course, only on a clear night), are so labeled be-cause in formation they resemble the outlines· of bears. The femi-nine name Ursula is, by etymology, "a little bear," which, perhaps, is a strange name to burden a child with. The skin disease lupus was so named because it eats into the flesh, as a wolf might. 
2.ayou can't go home againa
Nostalgia; built on two Greek roots, nostos, a return, and algos,apain {as in neuralgia, cardialgia, etc.), is a feeling you can't ever 





understand until you've experienced it-and you have probably experienced it whenever some external stimulus has crowded your mind with scenes from an earlier. day. 
You know how life often seems much pleasanter in retrospect? Your·conscious memory tends to store up the pleasant experiences of the past (the trauma and unpleasant experiences may get buried in the uncons.ious), and when you are lonely or unhappy you may begin to relive these pleasant occurrences. It is then that 
you feel the emotional P,、aineand longing that we call nostalgia. 

The adjective is nostalgic (nos-TAL'一jik),eas in "motion pie-tures that are nostalgic of the fifties," or as in, "He feels nostalgic whenever he pasJ;es· 138th Street and sees the house in which he grew up." 

3.esoundingseCacophony is itself a harsh-sounding word一andeis the only one that exactly describes the 
unmusical, grating, ear-offending noises you are likely to hear in man-made surroundings: the New York subway trains thundering through their tunnels (they are also, these days in the late 1970s, eye-offending, for which we might coin the term cacopsis, noun, and cacoptic, adjective), the traffic bedlam of rush hours in a big city, a steel mill, an automobile fac-tory, a blast furnace, etc. Adjective: cacophonous (k今KOF'-a-nas). 

These words are built on the Greek roots kakos, bad, harsh, or ugly, and phone, sound. 
Phone, sound, is found also in: 


1.etelephone-etymologically, "sound from afar"e
2. euphony-pleasant sounde
3.ephonograph-etymologically, "writer of sound"e
4.esaxophone一aemusical instrument (hence sound) invented by Adolphe Sax 
5.exylophone-a musical instrument; etymologically,''soundsethrough wood" (Greek功lon,ewood) 
6.ephonetics (f今NET'-iks)—theescience of the sounds of Ian-guage; the adjective is phonetic (f:i-NET'-ik), the expert a phone-tician (fo'-n:i-TISH'..gn) 
7. phonics-the science of sound; also the method of teachingoreading by drilling the sounds of letters and syllables 










423 




4.othe flesh and allo
Carnivorous combines carnis, flesh, and voro, to devour. A car-nivorous animal, or. carnivore (KAHR.'-n今vawr'),ois one whose main diet is meat. 
Voro, to devour, is the origin of other words referring to eating 
habits: 1.herbivorous (bur-BIV'心r-::is)—subsistingoon grains, grasses,oand other vegetation, as cows, deer, horses, etc. The animal is a herbivore (HUR'－阮vawr').Derivation: Latin herba, herb, plus 
voro, to devour 
2. omnivorous (om-NIV'-::ir-:is)--eating everything: meat,ograins, grasses, fish, insects, and anything else digestible. The only species so indiscriminate in their diet are humans and rats, plus, of course, some cats and dogs that live with people (in contrast to felines and canines-lions, tigers, bobcats, wolves, etc.-that are not domesticated). Omnivorous (combining Latin omnis, all, with 

voro, plus the adjective suffix -ous) refers not only to food. An omnivorous reader reads everything in great quantities (that is, devours all kinds of reading matter). 
3. voracious (vaw-RAY'-sbas）一-devouring;ohence, greedy or gluttonous; may refer either to food or to any other habits. One may be a voracious eater, voracious reader, voracious in one's pursuit of money, pleasure, etc. Think of the two noun forms of 
loquacious. Can you write two derived from voracious? (1)o(2)' nouns 
5.o"allness"
Latino叩心，all,ois the origin of:o
1.oomnipotent (om-NIP＇仑tant)-alI-powerful,oan adjectiveousually applied to God; also, 
to any ruler whose governing powers 
unlimited, which allows for exaggeration, as King Canare ute the Great proved to his sycophansome tic courtiers when he or-

dered the tide to come so far up the beach and no further. He got soaking wet! (Omnis plus Latin potens, potentis, powerful, as in potentate, a powerful ruler; impotent (IM'-p沁nt),epowerless; potent, powerful; and potential, possessing power or ability not yet exercised). Can you write the noun form of omnipotent? 


2.
om心ciente(om-NISH'-ant)e—all-knowing: hence, infinitelyewise.(Omnis plus sciens, knowing.) We have discussed this adjec-tive in a previous chapter, so you will have no problem writing the noun: 

3.eomnipresent (om勺l:>-PREZ'心nt)一presentein all places ateonce. Fear was omnipresent in Europe during 1939 just before World War II. A synonym of omnipresent is ubiquitous (y.-BIK.'-wa-tas), from Latin ubique, everywhere. The ubiquitous ice cream vendor seems to be everywhere at the same time, tinkling those little bells, once spring arrives. The ubiquitous little red wagon rides around everywhere in airports to refuel departing planes. "Ubiquitous laughter greeted the press secretary's re-inark," i.e., laughter was heard everywhere in the room. The noun forms 
are ubiquity (y砬BIK.'-w今tee)e



all." In the· shortened form bu.r we have a public vehicle for all who can pay; in a John Galsworthy omnibus we have a book con-faining all of Galsworthy's works; in an omnibus legislative bill we have a bill containing all the miscellaneous provisions and appro-priations left out of other bills. 

6.emore fleshe
Note how carnis, flesh, is the building block of:e
l.ecarnelian (kahr-NEEL'-yan)-aereddish color, the color ofered flesh. 

2.ecarnival (KAHR'-na-val)-0riginally the season of merry-making just before Lent, when people took a last fling before say-ing 
"Carne vale/" "Oh flesh, farewell!'.'(Latin vale, farewell, goodbye). Today a carnival is a kind of outdoor entertainment 




with games, rides, side shows; and, of course, lots of food—also any exuberant_ or riotous merrymaking or festivities. 
3. carnal (KAHR'-n:il)一mosteoften found in phrases likee
or appetites of the flesh rather than of the spirit—hence, sensual, lecherous, lascivious, lubricious, etc. The noun is carnality (kahr-NAL'-:i-tee). 
"carnal pleasures" ·or "carnal appetites," and signifying pleasures 
4.ecarnage (KAHR'-n:ij)—great destruction 
of life (that 
is, ofehuman flesh), as in war or mass murders. 
5.ereincarnation (ree'-in-kahr-NA Y'-sh:in)-a rebirth or reap-pearance. Believers in reincarnation maintain that one's soul per-sists after it has fled the flesh, and eventually reappears in the body of a newborn infant or animal, or in another form. Some of us, according to this interesting philosophy, were once Napoleon, Alexander the Great, Cleopatra, etc. The verb is to reincarnate (ree-in-KAHR'-nayt), to bring (a soul) back in another bodily form. 
6. incarnate (in-KAHR'-n:it)-in the flesh. If we use this adjec-tive to call someone "the devil incarnate," 
we mean that here is the devil in the flesh. Or we may say that someone is evil incar-nate, that is, the personification of evil, evil invested with human or bodily form. The verb to incarnate (in-KAHR'-nayt) is to em-body, give bodily form to, or make real. 
7.edark secrets 



Clandestine comes from -Latin clam, secretly, and implies se-crecy or concealment in the working out of a plan that is danger-ous or illegal. Clandestine is a close synonym of surreptitious (sur'勺p-TISH'-as),ewhich means stealthy, sneaky, furtive, gener-ally because of fear of detection. 
The two words cannot always, however, be used interchange-
ably. We may speak of either clandestine or surreptitious meetings 
or arrangements; but usually only of clandestine plans and only 
of SU汀eptitious·emovements or actions. Can you write the noun 
form of surreptitious?

(Answers in Chapter 18) 


GETTING USED TO NEW WORDS 


Reference has been made, in previous chapters, to the intimate relationship between reading and vocabulary building. Good boo比o-and the better magazines will not only acquaint you with a host ofonew -ideas (and, therefore, new words, since every word is theoverbalization of an idea), but also will help you gain a more com-plete and a richer understanding of the hundreds of words you 
areo

sufficient amount of stimulating reading—and that means, at mini-
learning through your work in this book. If you have been doing a mum, several magazines a week and at least three books of non-fiction 
a month一youohave been meeting, constantly, over and over again, the new words you have been learning in these pages. Every such encounter is like seeing an old friend in a new place.oYou know how much better you understand your friends whenoyou have a chance to see them react to new situations; similarly,oyou will gain a much deeper understanding of the friends youohave been making among words as you see them in different <:on-texts and in different pla.es.o


My recommendations in the past have been of non-fiction titles,o
but novels too are a rich source of additions to your vocabu-lary—provided you stay alert to the new words you will inevitablymeet in reading novels.The natural temptation, when you encounter a brand-new wordin a novel, :is to ignore it-the lines of the plot are perfectly clearoeven ifom皿yoof the au血or'sowords are not. I want to counsel strongly that you resist the temptation to ig-nore the unfamiliar words you may meet in your novel reading:oresist it with every ounce of your energy, for only by such resist-ance can you keep building your vocabulary as you read.oWhat should you do? Don't rush to a dictionary, don't botherounderlining the word, don't keep long lists of words that you will eventually look up en masse-these activities are likely to becomeo



439 





painful and you will not continue them for any great length of time. 
Instead, do something quite simple-and very effective. 
When you meet a new word, underline it with a mental pencil. That is, pause for a second and attempt to figure out its meaning fromoits use in the sentence or from its etymological root orprefix, if it contains one you have studied. Make a mental note of it, say it aloud once or twice-and then go on reading. 

That's all there is to it. What you are doing, of course, is developing the same type of mind-set toward the new word that you have developed toward the words you have studied in this book. And the results, of course, will be the same一youowill begin 
to notice the word occurring again and again in other reading you do, and finally, having seen it in a number of varying contexts, you will begin to get enough of its connotation and flavor to come to a fairly accurate understanding of its meaning. In this way you win be developing alertness not only to the words you have stud-ied in this book, but to all expressive and meaningful words. And your vocabulary will keep growing. 
But of .ourse that will happen only if you keep reading. 
I do not wish to recommend any particular novels or novelists, since the type of fiction one enjoys is a very personal matter. You doubtless know the kind of story you like—mystery, science fiction, spy, adventure, historical, political, romantic, Western, bi-ographical, one or all of the above. Or you may be entranced by novels of ideas, of sexual prowess, of fantasy, of life in different segments of society from your own. No matter. Find the kind of novel or novelist you enjoy by browsing in the public library or among the thousands of titles in bookstores that have a rich as-sortment of paperbacks as well as hardbacks. 


And then read! And keep on the alert for new words! You will 
find them by the hundreds and thousands. Bear in mind: people 
with rich vocabularies have been reading omnivorou.rly, vora-
ciously, since childhood一includingothe ingredients listed in small 
print on bread wrappers and cereal boxes. 

(End of Session 41) 







The spelling of English words is archaic, it's confusing, it's need-lessly complicated, and, if you have a sense of humor, it's down-right comical. In fact, any insulting epithet you might wish to 
level against ·our weird methods of putting letters together to form words would probably be justified一buteit's our spelling, and we're 
stuck with it. 

How completely stuck we are is illustrated by a somewhat Judi一ecrous· event that goes back to 1906, and that cost philanthropist Andrew Carnegie $75,000. 


Working under a five-year grant of funds from Carnegie, and headed by the esteemed scholar Brander Matthews, the Simplified Spelling Board published in that year a number of recom-mendations for bringing some small semblance of order out of the great chaos of English spelling. Their su郘estionseaffected a mere three hundred words out of the half niillion then in the language. Here are a few examples, to give you a general idea: 



SPELLING 
THEN CURRENT SIMPLIFIED SPELLING mediaeval medieval doubt dout debtor dettor head hed though tho 




through thru laugh la/ tough tuf knife nife theatre theater centre center phantom fantom 
These revisions seemed eminently sensible to no less a per-sonage than the then President of the United. States, Theodore Roosevelt. So delighted was he with the new garb in which these three hundred words could be clothed that he immediately or-dered that all government documents be printed in simplified spelling. And the result? Such a howl went up from the good citi-zens of the republic, from the nation's editors and schoolteachers and businessmen, that the issue was finally debated in the halls of Congress. Almost to a man, senators and representatives stood opposed to the plan. Teddy. Roosevelt, as you have doubtless heard, was a stubborn fellow一butewhen Congress threatened to hold up the W五teeHouse stationery appropriation unless the Pres-ident backed down, Teddy rescinded the order. Roosevelt ran for re-election some time later, and lost. That his attitude toward spelling contributed to his defeat is of course highly doubtful— nevertheless an opposition New York newspaper, the day the re-turns were in, malicioui;ly commented on the outgoing incumbent in a one-word simplified-spelling .itorial: "IBRUI" 
Roosevelt was not the first President to be justifiably outraged by our ridiculous orthography. Over a'hundred years ago, when Andrew Jackson was twitted on his poor speUing, he is supposed to have made this characteristic reply, "Wen, sir, it is a damned poor mind that cannot think of more than one way to speI1 a word!" And according to one apocryphal version, it was Jackson's odd spelling that gave birth to the expression "okay." Jackson thought, so goes the story, that "all correct" was spelled "or] kor-rect," and he used O.K. as the abbreviation for these words when he approved state papers. 
Many years ago, the British playwright George_ Bernard Shaw offered a dramatic proposal for reducing England's taxes. Just 







eliminate unnecessary letters from our unwieldy spelling, he said, and you'll save enough money in paper and printing to cut every-one's tax rate in half. Maybe it would work, but it's never been put to the test-and the way things look now, it never will be. Current. practice more and more 
holds spelling exactly where it is, bad though it may be. It is a scientific law of language that if enough people make a''mistake," the "mistake" becomes accepta-ble usage. That law applies to pronunciation, to grammar,. to word meanings, but not to spelling. Maybe it's because of our misbe-gotten faith in, and worship of, the p血tedoword-maybe it's be-cause written language tends to be static, while spoken language constantly changes. Whatever the cause, spelling today success-fully resists every logical effort at reform. "English 
spelling/'said Thorstein Veblen, "satisfies.all the requirements of the canons of 

reputability under the law of conspicuous waste. It is archaic, cumbrous, and ineffective." Perfectly true. Notwithstanding, it's here to stay. 
Your most erudite 
friend doubtless misspells the name of the Hawaiian guitar. I asked half a dozen members of the English de-partment of a large college to spell the word—without exception they responded with ukelele. Yet 
the only accepted form 
is ukulele. 
Judging from my experience with my classes at Rio Hondo Col-lege, half the population of the country must think the word is spelled alright. Seventy-five per cent of the members of my classes can't spell embarrassing or coolly. People· will go on misspelling these four words, but the authorized spellings will remain impervi-ous to change. 
Well, you know ·the one about Mohammed and the mountain. Though it's true that we have modernized spelling to a micro-scopic extent in the last eighty years (traveler, center, theater, me-dieval, 
labor, and 
honor, for example, have pretty much replaced traveller, centre, theatre, mediaeval, labour, and honour), still the resistance to change has not observably weakened. If spelling won't change, as it probably won't, those of us who consider our-selves poor spellers will have to. We.'IIjust have to get up and go to the mountain. 
Is it hard to· become 
a good speller? I have demonstrated over and over again in my classes that anyone of normal intelligence 





and average educational background can become a good speller in 
very little time. 

What makes the task so easy? 
First-investigations have proved that 95 per cent of the 
spelling errors that educated people m吐eeoccur in just one bun-dred words. Not only do we all misspell the same words-but we misspell them in about the same way. 
Second-correct spelling relies exclusively on memory, and the most effective way to train memory is by means of association or, to use the technical term, mnemonics. 
If you fancy yourself an imperfect or even a terrible speller, the chances are very great that you've developed a complex solely be-cause you misspell some or all of the hundred 
words with which this Intermission deals. When you have conquered this single list, and I shall immediately proceed to demonstrate how easy it is, by 
means of mnemonics, to do so, 95 per cent of your spelling difficulties will in all lilcelihood vanish. 
Let us start with twenty-five words from the list. In the first col-umn you will.find the correct spelling of each, and in the second col皿m the simple mnemonic that will forevermore fix that correct spelling in your memory.

1.eall righteTwo words, no matter what it means. Keep in mind that it's the opposite of all wrong. 
2.ecoollye
Of course you can spell cool-simply add the adverbial ending-ly.

4.esucceedeThe only three words in the entire

All other words with a similar-sound-

This is the word that means paper, 
and notice the -er in paper. In this spelling, the words means standing, and notice the -a in stand. 

Commend, which we all spell correctly, plus the prefix re-.

you will not be tempted to misspell 
it abscence. The superintendent in an apartment house collects the rent-thus you avoid superintendant. Science plus prefix con-.

Mere repetitious drill is of no value in learning to spell a word correctly. You've probably heard the one about the youngster who was kept after school because he was in the habit of using the ungrammatical expression "I have went." Miss X was going to cure her pupil, even if it required drastic measures. So she ordered him to write "I have gone" one thousand times. "Just leave your work on my desk before you go home," she said, "and I'll find it when I come in tomorrow morning." Well, there were twenty pages of neat script on her desk next morning, one thousand lines of "I have gone's," and on the last sheet was a note from the child. "Dear Teacher," it read, "I have done the work and I have went home." If this didn't actually happen, it logically could have, for in any drill, if the mind is not actively engaged, no learning will result. If you drive a car, or sew, or do any familiar and repe-titious manual work, you know how your hands can carry on an 


446 

accustomed task while your mind is far away. And if you hope to learn to spell by filling pages with a word, stop wasting your time. All you'll get for your trouble is writer's cramp. 
The only way to learn to spell those words that now plague you is to devise a mnemo戌cefor each one. 
li you are never quite sure whether it's indispe九ribleeor indis-pensable, you can spell it out one hundred, one thousand, or one million times-and the next time you have occasion to write it in a sentence, you'll still wonder whether to end it with -ible ore-able. But if you say to yourself just once that able people are generally indispensable, that thought will come to you whenever you need to spell the word; in a few seconds you've conquered another spelling demon. By engineering your own mnemonic through a study of the architecture of a troublesome word, you will become so quickly and completely involved with the correct spelling of that word that it will be impossible for you ever to be stumped agam. 


Let us start at once. Below you will find another twenty-five words from the list of one hundred demons, each offered to you in both the correct form and in the popular misspelling. Go through the test quickly, checking off what you consider a proper choice in each case. In that way you will discover which of the twenty-five you would be likely to get caught on. Then devise a personal mnemonic for each word you flunked, writing your ingenious re-suit out in the margin of the page. And don't be alarmed if some of your mnemonics.tum out kind cif silly一theesillier they are the more likely you are to recall tlJem in an emergency. One of my pupils, who could not remember how many l's to put into Iran-quillity (or is it tranquility?), shifted his mind into high gear and came up with this: "In the old days life was more tranquil than tciday, and people wrote with quills instead of fountain pens. Hence-tranquillity!" Another pupil, a 
girl who always chewed her nails over irr函stibleebefore she could decide whether to end it with -ible or-able, suddenly realized that a certain brand of lipstick was called i汀esistible,ethe point being of course that the only vowel in lipstick is i一hence,e-ible/ Silly, aren't they? But they work. Go ahead to the test now; and see how clever-0r silly一youecan be.

By now you're well on the way toward developing a definite su-periority complex about your spelling—.hich isn't a half-bad thing,for I've learned,working with my students, that many peo-
448 

pie think they're awful spellers, and have completely lost faith in their ability, solely because they get befuddled over no more than two dozen or so common words that they use over and over againand always misspell. Every other word they spell perfectly, but they still think they're prize boobs in spelling until their self-confidence is restored. So if you're beginning to gain more assur-ance, you're on the right track. The conquest of the one hundred common words most frequently misspelled is not going to assure you that you will always come out top man in a spelling bee, but it's certain to clean up your writing and bolster your ego. 
So far you have worked with fifty of the one hundred spelling demons. Here, now, is the remainder of the list. Test yourself, or have someone who can keep a secret test you, and discover which ones are your Waterloo. Study each one you miss as if it were a problem in engineering. Observe how it's put together and devise whatever association pattern will fix the correct form in yourmind. 
Happy spelling!

SESSION 42 
WORDS symbols of ideas--and we have been learning, discussing, anare d working with words -as they revolve around certain basic concepts. 

Starting with an idea (personality typ邸， doctors,ooccupations, science, lying, actions, speech, insults, .ompliments, etc.), have explored the meanings and uses of ien basic words; then, we working from each word, we have wandered off toward 
any ideas and additional words that a basic word might suggest, or toward any other words built on the same Latin or Greek roots. 
By this natural and logical method, you have been able to make meaningful and lasting coniact with fifty to a hundred or more words in each chapter. And you have discovered, I think, that 
while five isolated words may be difficult to learn in one day, fifty 
to a hundred or more related words are easy to learn in a few-ses-sions. In this session we learn words that tell what's going on, what's 
happening, what people do to each other or to themselves, or what others do to them. 


IDEAS. 

1.ocomplete exhaustiono
You have stayed up all night. And what 
were you doing? flay-ing poker, a very.pleasant way of whiling away time? No. Engag-ing in spme creative activity, lilce writing a short story, planning a political campaign, discussing fascinatin8 questions with friends? No. 
The examples I have offered are exciting or stimulating-as psychologists have disco:vered, -it is not work or effort that causes fatigue, but boredom, frustration, or a similar feeling. 






You have stayed up all night with a very sick husband, wife, child, or dear friend. And despite all your ministrations, the pa-tient.is.sinking. You can see how this long vigil contains all the el-ements. of frustration that contribute to mental, physical, and nervous fatigue. 
And so you are bushed-but completely bushed. Your exbaus-tion is mental, itis physiological, it is emotional. What verb expresses the effect of the night's frustrations on you? 
to enervate 
2.otongue-lashingo
You suddenly see the flashing red light 
as you glance in yourorear-view mirror. It's the middle of the night, yet the police flasher is clear as day--and then you hear the low growl of tlie siren. So you pull over, knowing you were speeding along at 70 on the SS-mile-an-hour-limit freeway-after all, there was not another car in sight on the deserted stretch of road you were traveling. 
The cop is pleasant, courteous, smiling; merely asks for your driver's license and registration; even says "Please." Feeling guilty and stupid, you become irritated. So what do you do? 
You lash out at the officer with all the verbal vituperation welling up in you from your self-anger. You scold him harshly for not spending his time looking for violent criminals instead of bar. assing innocent motorists; you call into question his honesty, his ambition, his fairness, even his ancestry. To no avail, of course-you stare at the traffic ticket morosely as,the police cruiser pulls away. 

What verb describes how you reacted? 







3.oaltruistico

Phyllis is selffess and self-sacrificing. Her husband's needs andodesires come first--even when they conflict with her own. Clothes for her two daughters are her main concern—eve11 if she has to 



453 
wear a seven-year-old coat and outmoded dresses so that Paula 
and Evelyn can look smart and trim. At the dinner table, she heaps everyone's plate—while she herself often goes without. 
Phyllis will deny herself, will scrimp and save--all to the end that she may offer her husband and children the luxuries that her low self-esteem does not pern廿teher to give herself. 
What verb expresses what Phyllis does? 
to self-abnegate 
4.erepetitione
You have delivered a Jong, complicated lecture to your class,eand now, to make sure that they will remember the important points. you restate the key ideas, the main thoughts. You offer, in short, a kind of brief summary, step by step, on让ttingeall extrane-ous details. 
What verb best describes what you do? 
to recapitulate 
5.eno joie de vivree
Perhaps you wake up some gloomy Monday morning (why is itethat Monday is always the worst day of the week?) and begin to think of ·the waste of the last five years. Intellectually, there has been no progress—you've read scarcely half a dozen books, haven't made one new, exciting friend, haven't had a startling or unusual thought. Economically, things are no better—same old debts to meet, same old hundred dollars in the bank, same old job, same old routine of the eight-to-five workdays, the tuna fish or chicken salad sandwich for lunch, the same dreary ride home. What a life! No change, nothing but routine, sameness, monotony—and for what? (By now you'd better get up-this type of think-ing never leads anywhere, as you've long since learned.) 
What verb describes how you think you live? 
to vegetate 


6. pretenseo

Your neighbor, Mrs. Brown, pops in without invitation to telloyou of her latest troubles with (a) her therapist, (b) her hairdresser, (c) her husband, 
(d) her children, and/or (e) her gynecologist. 

Since Florence Brown is dull to the point of ennui, and anyway you have a desk piled high with worlc you were planning to light into, you find it difficult to concentrate on what she is saying. However, you do not wish to offend her by sending her packing, or even by appearing to be uninterested, so you pretend rapt at-tention, nodding wisely at what you hope are the right places. 
What verb describes this feigning of interest? 

to simulate 
7. slight hint, no.more 
You are an author and are discussing with your editor the pos-sible avenues of publicity and advertising for your new book. At one point in the conversation the editor makes several statements which might一oromight not一beoconstrued to mean that the com-pany is going to promote the book heavily. For example,· "If we put some real money behind this, we might sell a few copies," or "I wonder if it would be a good idea to get you on a few talk shows..." No unequivocal commitments, no clear-cut promises, only the slight and oblique mention of possibilities. 
What verb expresses what the editor is doing? 

to intimate 
8. helpful 

Aspirin doesn't cure any diseases. Yet this popular and inex-pensive drug is universally used to lighten and relieve various un-· pleasant symptoms o_f disease: aches and pains, fever, inflamma-tions, etc. 
What verb expresses the action of aspirin? 

to alleviate 



9.ewhen the bell tollse

John Donne's lines (made famous by Ernest Hemingway):e
No man is an Iland, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away七yethe Sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promon-torie were, as well as if a Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were,· any ma心 deathediminishes me, because I am in-volved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee. 

are truer than you may think; any person who views another's pain with complete detachment or indifference is shutting off im-portant feelings. 

When people have suffered a bereavement (as through death) ; when they have been wounded by life or by friends; then is the time they most need to feel that they are not alone, that you share their misery with them even if you cannot directly alleviate their sorrow. Your sympathy and compassion are, of course, alleviation enough. 
What verb signifies this vicarious sharing of sorrow with some-one who directly suffers? 

to commiserate 


1 O. when two men propose 

Should you marry 
John or George? (You're strongly and equally attracted to both.) John is handsome, ·virile; tender; G切rgeeis stable, reliable, dependable, always there when you need him. George loves you deeply; John is more exciting. You decide on John, naturally. 

But wait—marrying John would mean giving up George, and with George you always know where you stand; he's like the Rock of Gibraltar (and sometimes almost as dull). So you change your mind-it's George, on more mature reflection. 
But how happy can you be with a husband who is not exciting? Maybe John would be best after all.... 


The pendulum swings back and forth一youecannot make up your mind and stick to it. (You fail to realize that your indecision proves that you don't want to inarry either one, or perhaps don't want to give either one up, or possibly don't even want to get mar-ried.) First it's John, then it's George, then -back to John, then George again. Which is it, which is it? 
What-verb describes your pendulum-like indecision?

SESSION 43 
ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 
1.emore than fatiguee
When you are enervated, you feel as if your nerves have beeneripped out-0r so the etymology of the wo.rd indicates. 

Enervate is derived from e一(ex一），out,eand Latin nervus, nerve. Enervation (en'-ar-V A Y'-shan) is not just fatigue, but complete devitalization一physical,eemotional, mental-as if every ounce of the life force has been sapped out, as if the last particle of energy has been drained away. 
Despite its similar appearance to the word energy, enervation is almost a direct antonym. Energy is derived from the Greek prefix en-, in, plus the root ergon, work; erg is the term used in physics for a unit of work or energy. Synergism (SIN＇一ar-jiz-am)-theeprefix syn-, together or with, plus ergon一isethe process by which two or more substances or drugs, by working together, produce a greater effect in combination than the sum total of their individual effects. 

Alcohol, for example, is a depressant. So are barbiturates and other soporifics. Alcohol and barbiturates work synergistically (sin'-ar-JIS'-tik'-lee)-the effect of each is increased by 
the other if the two are taken together. 
So if you're drinking, don't take a sleeping pill-0r if you must take a pill for your insomnia, don't drink—the combination, if not lethal, will do more to you than you may want done! 
Synergy (SIN＇一证jee)e. by the way
, is an alternate form of ”,nergism. 
2.everbal punishmente

Castigate is derived from a.Latin verb meaning to punish,· in present-day usage, the v'erb generally refers 
to verbal punishment, 




usually harsh and severe. It is somewhat synonymous with scold, criticize, rebuke, censure, reprimand, or berate, but much stronger than any of these--rail at, rant at, slash at, lash out at, or tongue-lash is a much closer synonym. When candidates for office c岱 tigate their opponents, they do not mince words. 

n
Can you constmct the noueform of castigate? 

3.esaying "Nol" to oneselfe

Abnegate is derived from Latin 
ab-, away (as in absent), plusenego, to deny-self-abnegation (ab'－呤GAY'-shan),ethen, is self-denial. Nego itself is a contraction of Latin neg-, not, no, and aio, I say; to be self-abnegating is to say "Nol" to what you want, as jf some inner censor were at work whispering,''No, you can't have that, you can't do that, you don't deserve that, you're not good enough for that..... " 

To negate (n今GA吓）iseto deny the truth or existence of, as in "The atheist negates God"; or, by extension, to destroy by w
orking against,邸 in,e"His indulgence in expensive hobbiese
you write the noun form of the verb negate? Negative and negativity obviously spring from the same source as negate. 

4.eheads and headingse

Latin caput, capitis means head. The captain is the head of anyegroup; the capital is the "head city" of a state or nation; and to decapitate (dee-KAP'仑ta邓）iseto chop off someone's head, a popular activity during the French Revolution after the guillotine was invented. Write the noun form of decapitate: 
Latin capitulum is a little head, or, by extension, the heading, or title, of a chapter. So when you recapitulate, you go through the chapter headings again (re-), etymologically speaking, or you summarize or review the main points. 
Remembering how the noun and adjective forms are derived 
461 










from adulate (Chapter 9), can you write the required forms of re-capitulate? 
NOUN: 
ADJECTIVE: 
When. you capitulate (ka-PICH匀ayt'),aetymologically you arrange in headings, or, as. the meaning of the verb naturally evolved, you arrange conditions of surrender, as when an army 
by further natural extension, you stop resisting and give capitulates to the enemy forces under prearranged conditions; or, 
"He realized there was no longer any point in resisting her ad-vances, so he reluctantly capitulated." Can you write the noun form of capitulate? 
5.amere vegetablesa
Vegetable is from Latin vegeto, to live and grow, which is whatavegetables do一butathat's all they do, so to vegetate, is, by impli-cation, to do no more than stay alive, stuck in a rut, leading an inactive, unstimulating, emotionally and intellectual_ly stagnant existence. Vegetation (vej'-:i-TAY'-sh:in) is any dull, passive, stag-nant existence; also any plant life, as the thick vegetation of a

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS 


1.enot the real McCoye


Simulate is from Latin simulo, to copy; and simulo itself derivesefrom the Latin adjectives similis, like or similar. 
Simulation (sim＇.y今LAY'-shan),ethen, is copying the real thing, pretending to be the genuine article by taking on a similar appearance. The simulation of joy is quite a feat when you really feel depressed; 

Genuine pearls grow inside oysters; simulated pearls are syn-thetic, but look like the ones from oysters.(Rub a pearl against your teeth to tell the difference--,-the natural pearl feels gritty.) So the frequent advertisement of an inexpensive necklace made of "genuine simulated pearls" can fool you if you don't know the word—you're being offered a genuine fake, 
Dissimulation (d妇血'-ya-LAY'-shan)eis something else! When you dissimulate (d今血'-y今layt'),eyou hide your true feelings by making a pretense of opposite feelings.(Then again, maybe it's not-·something completely else!) 

Sycophants are great dissimulators-they may feel contempt, 



465 
but show admiration; they may feel negative, but express abso-lutely positive agreement. 
A close synonym of dissimulate is dissemble (d今SEM'-b:il),owhich also is to hide true feelings by pretending the opposite; or, additionally, to conceal facts, 
or one's true intentions, by decep-tion; or, still further additionally, to pretend ignorance of facts you'd rather not admit, when, indeed, you're fully aware of them. 
The noun is dissemblance (d:i-SEM'-bl:ins). In dissimulate and dissemble, the negative prefix dis-acts largely to make both words pejorative. 
2. hints and helpso
The verb intimate is from Latin intimus, innermost, the sameoroot from which the adjective intimate (IN'七mat)oand its noun intimacy (lN'-ta-ma-see) are derived; but the relationship is only in etymology, not in meaning. An intimation (in'－氐MAY'-shan)ocontains a significance buried deep in the innermost core, only a hint showing. As you grow older, you begin to have intimations that you are mortal; when someone昢imsoao.45 at you, or when a truck comes ro.ring down at you as you drive absent-mindedly against a red light through an intersection, you are suddenly very 
. sure that you are mortal. Alleviate is a combination of Latin levis, light (not heavy), the prefix ad-, to, and the verb suffix. (Ad-changes to al-before a root starting with l-.) If something alleviates your pain, ·it makes your pain lighter for you; if I alleviate your sadness, I make it lighter to bear; and if you need some alleviation（今lee'-vee-AY'-sh;m) 
of your prob-lems, you need them made lighter and less burdensome. To qUevi-ate is to relieve only temporarily, not to cure or do away with. (Relieve is also from Levis, plus re一，again-toomake light or easy again.) The adjective form of alleviate is alleviative（今LEE'-vee-a沪tiv)-aspirinois an alleviative drug. Anything light will rise--so from the prefix e一 (ex一），out,oplus levis, we can construct the verb elevate, etymologically, to raise out, or, actually, raise up, as to elevate one's spirits, raise them up, make them lighter; or elevate someone to a higher position, which is what an elevator does. 





Have you ever seen a performance of magic in which a person or an object apparently rises in the. air as 
if floating? That's levita-tion (lev'-a-TAY'-shan)一risingethrough no visible means. (I've watched it a dozen times and never could figure it out!) The verb, to·so rise，让levitatee( 
And how about levity (LEV'今tee)?That's lightness too, but of a different sort-lightness in the sense of frivolity,:flippancy, joking, or lack of seriousness. especially when solemnity, dignity, or formality is required or more l\ppropriate, as in "tones of lev-ity," or as in,''Levity is out of place at a funeral, in a house of worship, at the swearing-in ceremonies of a President or Supreme Court Justice," or as in, "Okay, enough levity-now let's get down to business!" 
3.esharing someone's miserye
Latin miser, wretched, the prefix con-(which, as you know, be-comes com-before a root beginning with m-), together or with, and the verb suffix-ate are the building blocks from which com-miserate is. constructed. "I commiseriite with you," then, means, "I am wretched together with you一Ieshare your misery." The noun form? 
Miser，呻erly，呻erable,emisery all come from the same root. 

4.eswing and swaye
Vacillate-note the single c, double l-derives from Latinevacillo, to swing back and forth. The noun form?_ 


People who. swing back and forth in indecision, who are irreso-Jute, who can, unfortunately, see both, or even three or four, sides of every question, and so have difficulty making up their minds, are vacillato疗 (VAS'+I今tawr'-ee).eThey are also, usually, am-bivalent (am-BIV＇心血t)-theyehave con伍ctingeand 
simulta-neous emotions about the same person or thing; or they want to go but they also want to stay; or they love something, but theybate it too. The noun is ambivalence (am-BlV＇-a-le四）－fromeambi both. (Remember .ambivert and ambidextro匹 frome·chap-ter 3?) 





Ambivalence has best been defined (perhaps by Henny Young-man-if he didn't say it first, he should have) as watching your mother-in-,law drive over a cliff in your new Cadillac. 

To vacillate is to swing mentally or emotionally. To sway back and forth physically is oscillate--again note the double l—(OS'-a-layt'), from Latin oscillum, a swing. A pendulum oscillates, the arm of a metronome oscillates, and people who've had much too

TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE A从ATEUR ETYMOLOGIST 
We have previously met the Greek prefix syn-, together or with, in synonym ("names together") and sympathy ("feeling with"), and again in this chapter in synergism ("working together"). 
Syn-is a most useful prefix to know. Like Latin con-, (together or with) and ad-(to, toward), the final letter changes depending on the first letter of the root to which it is attached. Syn-becomes sym-before b, m, and p. 
Can you construct some words using syn-, or sym才o

1. Etymologically, Jews are "led together" in a house of wor-ship (agogos, leading). Can you construct the word for this tern-
pie or place of \1/orship? 

2. There is a process by which dissimilar organisms live to-gether (bios, life) in close association, each in some way helping, and getting help from, the other (like the shark and the pilot fish). What word, ending in -sis, designates such a process? 
3. Using Greek phone, sound, write the word that etymo-logically refers to a musical composition in which the sounds 
4. Combine sym-with metron, measurement, to construct a word designating similarity of shape on both sides (i.e., "measure-ment together''): 





are the building blocks of a 
medical word designating a group of symptoms that occur (i.e., run) together in certain diseases. Can you figure out the word? 
6.oThe same dromos, a running, combines with Greek hippos,ohorse, to form a word referring to a place in ancient Greece in 


which horse and chariot races were run. The word? 

7.eHippos,-horse, plus Greek potamos, river, combine to form aeword designating one of the three pachyderms we discussed in an earlier chapter. The word? 

(Answers in Chapter 18.) 
PICKING YOUR FRIENDS'BRAINS 
You can build your vocabulary, I have said, by increasing your familiarity with new ideas and by becoming alert to the new words you meet in your reading of magazines and books. 
There is still another productive method, one that will be partic-ularly applicable in view of all the new words you are learning from your study of these pages. 

That method is picking your frien心brains.e

e
Intelligent people are interested in words because words aresymbols of ideas, and the person with an alert mind is always in-terested in ideas. 
You may be amazed, if you have never tried it, to find that you can stir up an animated discussion by asking, in a social group that you attend, "What does mean?" (Use any word that particularly fascinates you.) Someone in the group is likely to know, and almost everyone will be willing to make a guess. From that point on, others in the group will ask questions about their own favorite words (most people do have favorites), or about words that they themselves have in some manner recently learned. As the discussion continues along these lines, you will be introduced to new words yourself, and if your friends have fairly good vocabularies you may strike a rich vein of pay dirt and come away with a large number of words to add to your vocabulary. 
This method of picking your friends'brains is particularly fruit-ful because you will be learning not from a page of print (as in this book or as in your other reading) but from real live persons -the same sources that children use to increase their vocab-


ularies at such prodigious rates. No learning is quite as effective as the learning that comes from other people—no information in print can ever be as vivid as information that comes from another human being. And so the words you pick up from your friends will have an amazingly strong appeal, will make a lasting impres-sion on your mind. 
Needless to say, your own 
rich vocabulary, now that you have come this far in the book, will make it possible for you to contrib-ute to your friends'vocabulary as much as, if not more than, you take away一but since giving to others is one. of the greatest sources of a feeling of self-worth, you can hardly complain about this extra dividend.

TAKE TIIlS SPELLING TEST 


Even in the most painstakingly edited of m吧而nes,ea silly little misspelling of a perfectly common word will occasionally appear. How the error eluded the collective and watchful eyes of the edi-tor, the associate editor, the assistant editor, the typesetter, and the proofreader, no ope will ever know—for practically every re迅ereof the magazine spots it 
at once and writes an indignant letter, beginning:''Didn't you ever go to school... ?" 
Even if you went to school, you're going to have plenty of trou-ble spotting the one misspelled word in each group below. And not one of these words will be a demon like sphygmo血nometere(a device for measuring blood pressure) or piccalilli (a highly seasoned relish), which no one would ever dare spell without first checking with a dictionary. On the contrary, every word will be of the common or garden variety that you might use every day in your social or business 
Nevertheless, you're letting yourself in for ten minutes of real trouble, for you will be working with fifty particularly difficult spelling words. So put on your thinking cap before you begin. 
A half-dozen high school teachers who took this test were able tom吐eean average score of only five proper choices. Can you do better? Six or seven right is very good, eight or nine right is excel-lent, and 100 per cent success marks you as an absolute expert in English spelling.

.snobbish, haughtily contemptuous, arrogant?

SESSION 45 
There are thousands of English words that end in the letters -ous -a Latin suffix meaning full of. 

The central theme about which the words in this chapter revolve is the idea of "fullness” —and as you will shortly see, you can be full of compliance and servility; fuJI of complaints; full of snob-bery; full of noise; full of no money; full of horsemanship; fuJJ of harmlessness; full of liquor; full of deathly pallor; and full of sor-rows. 
For each of these ideas English has a word一andethe person with a rich vocabularly knows the exact word to describe what someone is full of. 

IDEAS 

1. compliance 
The Latin root sequor means to follow一andethose who followerather than lead are usually in a menial, subordinate, or inferior position. People who engage in certain fields of endeavor一 
waiters, clerks, and servants, for example—are forced, often con-trary to their natural temperaments, to act excessively courteous, pleasant, obliging, even subservient and humble. They must follow the lead of their customers or employers, bending their own wills according to the desires of those they serve. They are, etymologi-cally, full of following after, or一 
obsequious 
RELATED WORDS: 



1. obsequies—In a funeral cortege, the mourners follow after the corpse. Hence, obsequies are the burial ceremonies, the funeral rites. 
2.esubsequent—A subsequent letter, paragraph, time, etc. is oneethat follows another. 
3. sequel—A sequel may be a literary work, such as a novel,ethat follows another, continuing the same subject, dealing with the same people or village, etc. or it may be an occurrence that grows out of or follows another, as in, "Just wait until you hear the sequel to the story!" 
4. sequence-In order, one item following another,· as in, "The sequence of events of the next few days left him breathless." 





Any other word containing the root sequ-i. likely to have some relationship to the idea of followi卼e
2.ecomplaintse

The Latin root queror means to complain-and anyone full ofecomplaints, constantly nagging; harping, fretful, petulant, whin-ing, never satisfied, may accordingly be called一e

querulous 
3. snobberye

The Latin root cilium means eyelid; super means above,· and above the eyelid, as anyone can plainly see, is the eyebrow. Now there are certain obnoxious people who go around raising their eyebrows in contempt, disdain, and sneering arrogance at ordi-nary mortals like you and me. Such contemptuous, sneering, over-bearingly conceited people are called一 
supercilio匹 
-4. noise 

The Latin root strepo means to make a noise. Anyone who is unruly, boisterous, resistant to authority, urunanageable-and in a noisy, troublesome manner一ise

obstreperous 



5. moneylesso
The Latin root pecus means cattle一andoat one time in human history a person's wealth was measured not by stocks and bonds but by stocks of domestic animals, which was a Jot more logical, since you get milk and leather and meat from cattle-true wealth 一andoall you get from the stock market is a headache. 
Someone who had Jots of pecus, then, was rich—someone without pecus was indigent, destitute, "broke." And so today we call someone who is habitually without funds, who seems generalJy to be full of a complete lack of money一 

lmpecumous 


This word is not a synonym of indigent, destitute, or poverty-stricken; it does not necessarily imply living in reduced. circum-stances or want, but quite simply being short of cash一habitually.o
RELATED WORD: 
1.pecuniary一pertainingoto money, as in, a pecuniary consid-eration, pecuniary affairs, etc. 

6. horseso
The French word cheval means horse; and in medieval times only gentlemen and knights rode on horses-common people walked. Traditionally (but not, I understand, actually) knights were courteous to women, attentive to female desires, and self-sacrificing when their own interests came in conflict with those of the fair sex. Hence, we call a modem man who has a knightly attitude to women一 

chivalrous 
RELATED WORDS: (Cheval, horse, comes from Latin caballus, an inferior horse. Callabus is found in English words in the spelling caval-.) 

1.ocavalcade一Aoprocession of persons on horseback, as in a parade. 

—
2. cavalieroAs a noun, a cavalier was once a mounted soldier. 




As an adjective, c;,叮alierodescribes actions and attitudes that are· haughty, unm血fuloof others'feelings, too offhand, such attributes often being associated with people in power (the military being one of the powers-that-be). Thus, "He answered in a cavalier man-ner''would signify that he was arrogant in his answer, as if the questioner were taking a little too much privilege with him. Or, “A仕erothe cavalier treatm.nt I received, I n.ver wished to return," signifying that I was pretty much made to feel unimportant and inferior. Or, "After her c叩alierorefusal, I'll never invite her to another party," signifying that the refusal was, perhaps, curt, o氐ohand, without any attempt-at apology or courtesy. 

3.ocavalry-The mounted, or "horsed" part of an army.o
4.ochivalry-Noun form of chivalrous. Can you write the alter-nate noun form ending in -ness? 
5.ochivalric-Less commonly used adjective form, identical inomeaning to chivalro皿o


Another Latin root for horse, as you know, is equus, found in words we have already discussed: 
1. equestrian一Aohorseman. 
2. equestrienne一Aohorsewoman. 

3.oequine---Horselike.o
7.ono harm doneo

The latin root noceo means to injure;-someone who need causeoyou no fear, so harmless is that person, so unable to interfere, so unlikely to get you into trouble, is called一 
innocuous 

旺LATEDoWORDS: 
1.oinnocent-Not guilty of crime or injury.o
2.onoxious-Harmful, poisonous; unwholesome.o


8.oalcoholico

The Latin root bibo means to drink; and one· who is generallyofound with one foot up on the brass rail, who likes to tipple be-




yond the point of sobriety—who, in short, has an overfondness for drinks with a pronounced alcoholic content, is called, usually humorously-

bibulous 
RELATED WORDS: 
1. imbibe一Toedrink in, soalc up, absorb. H we use this verb without specifying what is drunk, as in, "He likes to imbibe," the implication, of course, is always liquor; but imbibe may also be used in patterns like "imbibe learning" or "In early infancy she imbibed a respect for her parents." 
2. bib一Upperepart of an apron, or an apronlike napkin tied around a ·child's neck. In either case, the bib prevents what is drunk (or eaten) from spilling over, or dribbling down, on the wearer's clothing. 


9.elike death itself ·e
The Latin root cado means to fall-one's final fall is of courseealways in death, and so someone who looks like a corpse (figura-tively speaking), who is pale, gaunt, thin, haggard, eyes deep-sunk, limbs wasted, in other words the extreme opposite of the picture of glowing health, is called一 
ca4averous 
RELATED WORDS: 
1.ecadave,—A corpse, literally, especially one used for surgicaledissection. 
2.edecadent-Etymologically, "falling down" (de-is a prefixeone meaning of which is down, as in descend, climb down; decline, turn down; etc.). If somet出ngeis in a decadent state, it is deterio-rating, becoming corrupt or demoralized. f!_ecadence is a state of decay. Generally decadent 
and decadence are used figuratively -they refer not to actual physical decay (as of a dead body), buteto moral or spiritual decay.e


1 0. pain and misery 
The Latin root doleo means to suffer or grieve--one who is 






483 


mournful and sad, whose melancholy comes from physical pain or mental distress, who seems to be suffering or grieving, is called-
dolorous 
RELATED WORDS: 

1.edolor—A poetic synonym of grief.e
2.edoleful—A word referring somewhat humorously to exag-gerated dismalness, sadness, or dreariness. 
3. condole—Etymologically, to suffer or grieve with (Latin con-, with, together). Condole is a somewhat less commonly used synonym of commiserate, a verb we discussed in Chapter 15. The noun condolence is much more frequently heard than the verb, as in, "Let me offer you my condolences," usually said to someone mourning the death of a friend or relative. You· have heard of condolence cards, and no doubt have sent your share of them. When you condole with somebody who has sustained a loss, usu-ally by death, you are saying, in effect, "I am suffering or grieving with you."

BOW TO KEEP,BUILDING YOUR VOCABULARY 

At commencement exercises, whether in elementary school, high school, orcollege, at least one of the spealcers will inevitably point out to the graduates that this is not the end—not by a long shot. It is only the beginning; that's why it is called "commencement," etc., etc. 
Of course the speaker is right—no educative process is ever the end; it is always the beginning of more education, more learning, moreliving. 
And that is the case here. What has happened to you as a result of your reaction to the material and suggestions in this book is only the beginning of your development. To stop increasing your vocabulary is to stop your intellectual growth. You will wish, I am sure, to continue growing intellectually as long as you remain alive. And with the momentum that your weeks of hard work have provided, continuing wii'not be at all difficult. 
Let me offer, as a summary of all I have said throughout the book, a recapitulation of the steps you must take so that your vo-cabulary will keep growing and growing. 

STEP ONE. You must become actively receptive to newwords. Words won't come chasing after you一you must train yourself 
to be on a constant lookout, in your reading and listening, for any 



STEP 1WO. You must read more. 
As an adult, you will find most of the sources of your supply of new words in books and magazines. Is your reading today largely restricted to a quick perusal of the daily newspaper? Then you will have to change your habits. If your aim is to have a superior vocabulary, you will have to make the time to read at least one book and several magazines every week. Not just this week and next week一buteevery week for the rest of your life. I have never met a single. person who possessed a rich vocabulary who was not also an omnivorous reader. 
STEP THREE. You must learn to add to your own vocabulary the new words you meet in your reading. 
When you see an unfamiliar word in a book or magazine, do not skip over it impatiently. Instead, pause for a moment and say it over to yourself-get used to its sound and appearance. Then puzzle out its possible meaning in the context.of the sentence. Whether you come to the right conclusion or not, whether indeed you are able to come to any intelligent conclusion at all, is of no importance. What is important is that you are, by this process, becoming superconscious of the word. As a result, you will sud-
denly notice that this very word pops up unexpectedly again and again in all your reading—for you now have a mind-set for it. And of course after you've seen it a few times, you will know fairly accurately not only what it means but the many ways in which it can be used. 
STEP FOUR, You must open your mind to new ideas. Every word you know is the translation of an idea. 
may 
possibly be unknown to you—psychology, semantics, science, 
Think for a few minutes of the areas of human knowledge that 

plest to the most abstruse, there are several books written for the average, untrained lay reader that will give you both a good grasp of the subject and at the same time add immeasurably to your vo-cabulary. College students 
have large vocabularies because 
they 

are required to expose themselves constantly to new areas of learning. You must do the same. 
STEP FIVE. You must set a goal. 

If you do nothing about your vocabulary, you will learn, at most, twenty-five to fifty new words in the next twelve months. By conscious effort you c:皿 learneseveral tho匹and.eSet yourself a goal of finding several new words every day; This may sound am. bitious-but you will discover as soon as you start actively look-ing for new words in your reading, and actively doing reading of a more challenging type, that new words are all around you一thate
is, if you're ready for them. And understand this: vocabulary building snowballs. The results of each new day's search will be greater and greater-:0nce you provide the necessary initial push, once you gain momentum, once you become addicted to looking for, finding, and taking possession of new words. 
And this is one addiction well worth cultivating!

AWOL. Pass the buck. Blitz. Panic Button. 
One of the special traits of American English is its ablility to absorb new words and metamorphize new meanings for existing words. A primary impetus for this has always been war. In his new book, WAR SI.ANG, noted word historian and author Paul Dickson offers the first comprehensive collection of fighting words and phrases _used by Americans at war.
