比较适合你  抽烟吗

在七十年代末  银行业
In the late '70s, banking wasn't a job

24
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,130
可赚不了大钱
you went into to make large sums of money.

25
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,740
就是他妈的小打小闹
It was a fucking snooze.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,620
纽约大都会赢了吗
How about those Mets?

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,370
充斥着废柴  比如卖保险的
Filled with losers. Like selling insurance or

28
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,790
或者会计师
accounting.

29
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,020
如果说银行业无聊的话
And if banking was boring,

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,810
那银行的债券部门简直就让人昏昏欲睡
then the bond department at the bank was straight-up comatose.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,000
我们都知道债券是怎么回事
We all know about bonds.

也许等他到了三十岁能赚个一百块

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,640

That is, until Lewis Ranieri came on the scene

Let's make some money! What do you say?

41

路易斯还没有意识到
You see, Lewis didn't know it yet,

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,790

Or private-label MBS.

你们都有普通的住房抵押贷款
You've got your average person's mortgage.

固定利率  三十年期
Fixed rate, 30 years.

48
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,150
风险小  回报低  对吧
Boring, safe, small payoff, right? But,

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,140
但当你把成千上万的贷款绑在一起
when you have thousands of them all bundled together,

50
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,770
突然间投资收益上升了但风险依然很小
suddenly the yield goes up but the risk is still small because,

51
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,810
因为它们是住房抵押贷款
well, they're mortgages!

52
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,310
谁会不还住房抵押贷款呢
And who the hell doesn't pay their mortgage?

这种债券的信用评级是多少

先生们  这种债券是AAA级的

银行家们从乡村俱乐部到了脱衣舞俱乐部
the banker went from the country club to the strip club.

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,270
很快  股票和储蓄变得无足轻重

也许是美国经济一个时代的终结

158
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,420
是的
Yeah.

159
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,960
马上去  柏利博士
Right away, Dr. Burry.

160
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,340
我是个好人
I am a nice guy all day long.

161
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,110
随便问问谁  我和人相处融洽
Ask anyone, I'm a pleasure to work with.

162
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,370
但一旦我儿子搞砸了  我
But the second my son screws up, I am...

163
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,540
冲他吼得就像我父亲吼我一样
...yelling at him just like my dad did to me.

164
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,240
我听见从嘴里出来的话
I hear the words that are coming out of my mouth and...

165
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,470
抱歉我迟到了  打不到车
Sorry I'm late! No cabs.

166
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,220
听听这个
So, get this.

167
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,470
我昨天见了一位零售银行家
I met with this retail banker yesterday.

168
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,130
我本来应该让他投资一个基金的
I'm supposed to be getting him to invest in a fund,

169
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,540
但取而代之的是
but instead

170
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,500
我开始盘问他透支的罚金
I start grilling him about overdraft penalties

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,590
以及他的银行是如何让顾客写了
and how his bank will let a customer write 10-12 checks

172
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,930
十到十二张支票才告诉他们已透支的
before they tell them they're overdrawn.

173
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,420
这个变态
And this creep is making

174
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,930
通过这种方式挣了上百万
billions off screwing over people this way.

175
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,810
我越来越生气
And I'm getting madder and madder.

176
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,270
我看着他的脸对他说
And I ask him, I look him in the face and I say,

177
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,200
"你明知在剥削工薪阶层
"How can you sleep at night

178
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,150
晚上还怎么睡得着"
knowing that you are ripping off working people?"

179
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,940
你们知道他怎么做的吗  他走了
And you know what he did? He left.

180
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,740
他就那么走了  什么都没说
He just walks out of the lunch, doesn't say a word.

181
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,820
他妈的这算什么
What the fuck is that?

182
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,240
那种情形下是谁搞砸了  是我吗
Who's fucked up in that scenario? Am I?

183
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,780
还是把我晾在那里的那个混蛋
Or is this douchebag, who leaves me hanging?

184
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,120
是他搞砸了吗
Is he the fucked up one?

185
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,000
我们已经谈论过很多次了
We have talked about this numerous times.

186
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,210
你不能迟到还劫持整个互助会
You can't come in late and hijack the entire session.

187
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,750
什么意思  我并没有劫持互助会
What do you mean? I didn't hijack the meeting.

188
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,940
我劫持了互助会吗
Did I hijack the session?

189
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,190
是的
Yeah.

190
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,810
你是做什么的
What do you do?

191
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,090
我做期货的
I'm in commodities.

192
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,470
祝你好运
Good luck with that.

193
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,140
马克  我知道你损失了很多
Mark, I know you suffered a terrible loss.

194
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
也许你想谈谈这个
Maybe you want to talk about that.

195
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,770
我不想谈
I don't talk about that.

196
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,270
稍等
Hold on.

197
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,680
等一下
Hold on...

198
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,620
该死  这个我必须得接  抱歉
Shit, I have to take this. Sorry. Sorry.

199
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,650
不  我不管  波特
No... I don't care, Porter.

200
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,320
这家伙的生意是建立在剥削他人之上
This guy's whole business is built on ripping people off.

201
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,000
这样能维持多久
How long can that last?

202
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,630
各位再见
Bye, everybody!

203
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,380
九十五
95...

204
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,760
那是三十天后  六十天后
That's 30 days late... Sixty days late...

205
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,670
他们付款及时...
They pay on time...

206
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,230
这些信贷评分...
These FICO scores...

207
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,930
晚了  他们被发现...
Late. And they caught up on their payments...

208
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,510
又晚了三十天付款...
Another 30 days late...

209
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,850
客户终身价值  95  90  他们被发现...
LTV, 95... LTV, 90... They caught up on their payments...

210
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,480
晚了六十天付款  天哪
Sixty days late? Jesus!

211
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,690
客户终身价值  110  从没见过这样的
LTV, 110? I've never heard of that!

212
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,120
晚了三十天  利率调整
Thirty days late, rate adjusts...

213
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,360
07年调整了
In '07 rate adjusts...

214
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,630
06年调整了
In '06 rate adjusts...

215
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,030
95  90  天哪
95... 90... Jesus!

216
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,360
他一整天都没离开过
He hasn't moved all day.

217
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,780
他每隔几天就会这样
He does this every few days.

218
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,540
他雇了我之后就没跟我说过话
He hasn't spoken to me since he hired me.

219
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,040
也许客户终身价值在...  高风险
Maybe the LTV's at... High-risk,

220
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,370
只有利率  我从没听过那个抵押历史
interest-only... I never heard of that mortgage history,

221
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,210
我从没听过  怎么可能
I never heard of that... How?

222
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,580
迈克尔  你好吗
Michael, how are you, guy?

223
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,710
劳伦斯  我发现了些很有趣的事
Lawrence, I found something really interesting.

224
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,720
很好  迈克尔  每次你发现有趣的事
Great, Michael. Whenever you find something interesting,

225
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,010
我们都赚钱了
we all tend to make money.

226
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,480
你在估值哪只股票
What stock are you valuing?

227
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,930
不  不是股票
No, no, no, no. No stocks.

228
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,070
我想要做空房地产市场
I want to short the housing market.

229
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,160
是吗  房地产市场可是稳如磐石啊
Really? But the housing market is rock solid.

230
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,060
格林斯潘刚刚才说
Greenspan just said

231
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,700
泡沫是区域性的  违约是少见的
bubbles are regional, defaults are rare.

232
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,940
告诉他们我一会儿就来
Tell them I'll be there in a minute.

233
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,820
-再说一遍  -听着
- Say again? - Look, look...

234
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,740
格林斯潘是错误的
Greenspan's wrong.

235
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,240
我觉得你不是故意这样的  但有时你听起来
I don't think you mean to do this, but sometimes you sound very

236
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,620
相当轻蔑  满是优越感
dismissive and superior.

237
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,870
这是事实  格林斯潘是错的
It's a fact. Greenspan's wrong.

238
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,290
我不知道你还想让我说什么
I don't know how else you want me to say...

239
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,750
迈克尔
Look, Michael.

240
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,460
大都会资本四年前在你
Metro Capital backed you four years ago

241
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,330
还只是一名医生  只有一个
when you were a doctor with a

242
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,750
小网站和一些遗产的时候支持了你
dinky webpage and some inheritance money.

243
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,840
我们都做得很好
We've all done very well.

244
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,050
你为什么不专注于股票呢
Why don't you just stick with stocks?

245
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,260
你了解我  我...
Look. You know me. I, I, I...

246
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,090
我会寻找一切投资价值
I look for value wherever it can be found.

247
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,260
事实是
And the fact is

248
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,570
那些住房抵押贷款支持证券充满了
that these mortgage-backed securities are filled

249
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,100
极度危险的可调利率次级贷款
with extremely risky subprime adjustable-rate loans.

250
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,690
等大多数浮动利率
And when the majority of the adjustable rates

251
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,040
在07年开始执行时
kick in, in '07,

252
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,360
他们就会开始下跌
they will begin to fail.

253
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,780
如果下跌超过15%  整个债券就一文不值了
And if they fail above 15%, the whole bond is worthless.

254
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,030
迈克尔  休息一下
Michael, just take a beat.

255
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,320
我们晚点再谈这个  好吗
We'll talk about this later, okay?

256
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,450
劳伦斯  请不要敷衍我  听着
Lawrence, please, don't patronize me. Listen...

257
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,000
住房抵押贷款支持证券
Mortgage-backed securities.

258
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,390
它
It, it, it...

259
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,290
次级贷款  打包在一起
Subprime loans. Tranches.

260
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,040
很难懂的概念  对吗
It's pretty confusing, right?

261
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,750
让你觉得厌烦  或者愚蠢吗
Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid?

262
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,130
就应该这样
Well, it's supposed to.

263
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,800
华尔街喜欢用复杂的概念
Wall Street loves to use confusing terms

264
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,570
让你觉得只有他们才能做那些事情
to make you think only they can do what they do.

265
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,100
或者更好的是
Or, even better,

266
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,560
让你远离他们
for you to just leave them the fuck alone.

267
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,600
所以用玛格特·罗比的泡泡浴解释一下
So here's Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to explain.

268
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,850
通常来说  路易斯·拉涅利的抵押债券
Basically, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bonds

269
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,230
对于大银行来说利润丰厚
were amazingly profitable for the big banks.

270
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,280
他们通过卖这些债券所收取的
They made billions and billions on their 2% fee

271
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,570
2%的手续费赚取了亿万财富
they got for selling each of these bonds.

272
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,070
但接着抵押住房资源开始枯竭
But then they started running out of mortgages to put in them.

273
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,830
毕竟只有那么多的房屋
After all, there are only so many homes

274
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,660
只有那么多有能力买它们的人
and so many people with good enough jobs to buy them, right?

275
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,830
于是银行开始用更有风险的
So the banks started filling these bonds

276
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,090
房贷来支持这些债券
with riskier and riskier mortgages.

277
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,340
谢谢你  本特
Thank you, Benter.

278
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,970
那样的话他们就能继续盈利了  对把
That way they can keep that profit machine churning, right?

279
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,430
对了  这些高风险房贷叫次级贷款
By the way, these risky mortgages are called subprime.

280
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,890
所以每当你听见次级贷款
So whenever you hear "Subprime", think

281
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,430
就意味着狗屎
"Shit".

282
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,060
我们的朋友迈克尔·柏利发现了这些抵押债券
Our friend Michael Burry found out that these mortgage bonds

283
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,360
本应该65%都是AAA级组成
that were supposedly 65% AAA

284
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,210
实际上大部分都是狗屎
were actually just mostly full of shit.

285
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,530
所以他现在要做空这些债券
So now he's going to "Short" the bonds.

286
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,630
意思是说打赌它要完蛋
Which means to "Bet against".

287
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,510
明白了吗
Got it?

288
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,470
很好
Good.

289
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,830
现在滚蛋吧
Now fuck off.

290
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,830
其他人发现这个投资机会
It's only a matter of time

291
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,250
只是时间问题
before someone else sees this investment.

292
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,040
我们现在就需要行动
We have to act now!

293
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,380
你怎么知道债券没有价值
How do you know the bonds are worthless?

294
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,670
他们不是都是上千页的
Aren't they filled with fucking thousands

295
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,880
房贷支持的吗
of pages of mortgages?

296
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,220
我读过它们了
I read them.

297
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,220
-你读过了  -我读过了  是的
- You read them? - I read... Yes.

298
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,420
没人会读它们
No one reads them. Only

299
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,520
只有整理它们的律师才会读它们
the lawyers who put them together read them.

300
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,330
听着  我觉得他们都不知道自己创造了什么
Look, I don't think that they even know what they've made.

301
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,710
房地产市场是由这些糟糕的
The housing market is propped up on these

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,650
房贷撑起来的
bad loans, and I'm...

303
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,780
这是颗定时炸弹  我想做空它
It's a time bomb, and I want to short it.

304
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,160
用什么金融工具呢  迈克尔
Through what instrument, Michael?

305
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,240
抵押债券没有保险合同或者期权
There are no insurance contracts or options for mortgage bonds.

306
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,590
债券太稳固了
The bonds are too stable.

307
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,010
劳伦斯
Lawrence...

308
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,190
我准备这么做  我要找家银行
This is what I'm gonna do. I am gonna get a bank

309
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,560
给我做一个
to make me one.

310
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,860
然后
And then

311
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,400
我会买下来
I'm gonna buy it.

312
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,550
我不想做那种生意
I don't want that kind of business.

313
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,320
要赚钱有道  那是不义之财
Money is not money. That's bad money.

314
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,200
拜托
Hey! Excuse me!

315
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,480
我问你  有哪家公司对待顾客
Let me ask you this. What company treats its customers

316
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,170
那么糟糕还能成功的
that shittily and succeeds?

317
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,860
好吧  高盛  有道理
Fine. Okay, Goldman. You're right.

318
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,110
马克·鲍姆在工作中
Mark Baum had built his

319
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,410
坚信没有证据就不能假设任何人
career on never assuming anyone or any company

320
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,160
或任何公司是合法的
was legit without proving it.

321
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,690
他小时候在正统犹太小学
When he was a kid he excelled

322
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,870
学习《塔木德经》异常出色  随便了
at studying the Talmud in Yeshiva. Whatever.

323
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,830
但有一天拉比告诉了他妈妈原因
But one day his rabbi told his mom why.

324
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,450
保罗这孩子不错
Paul is a fine boy,

325
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,060
而马克《律法书》
and Mark is an excellent student

326
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,750
和《塔木德经》都学得很好
of the Torah and the Talmud.

327
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,800
那有什么问题吗  拉比
Then what's the problem, rabbi?

328
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,070
关键在于马克那么努力学习的原因
It's the reason Mark is studying so hard.

329
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,070
他想找出真主话语里前后不一致的地方
He's looking for inconsistencies in the word of God!

330
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,990
那他找到了吗
So has he found any?

331
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,310
后来鲍姆在华尔街设立了自己的基金
Later, Baum started his own fund on Wall Street.

332
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,820
他对牛粪反应灵敏
He had an amazing nose for bullshit.

333
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,900
他不担心让别人知道
And he wasn't afraid to let anyone know when and where

334
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,610
何时何地牛就要拉屎了
the bull had gone number two.

335
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,320
但后来马克遇上了悲剧
But then a tragedy happened to Mark,

336
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,870
使他的世界观变得一片黑暗
and it turned his world view dark

337
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,290
相信整个系统都谎话连篇
and ready to believe the whole system was a lie.

338
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,910
稍等
Hold on.

339
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,720
是辛西娅
It's Cynthia.

340
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,850
我二十分钟内到办公室
I'll be in the office in 20 minutes.

341
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,930
亲爱的
Hi, honey.

342
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,110
心理医生打电话来  你又那样了
The therapist called. You did it again.

343
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,260
打不到车  你说我该怎么办
There were no cabs. What was I supposed to do?

344
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,010
我担心你  马克
I worry about you, Mark.

345
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,440
至少我去了
At least I went.

346
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,680
你这样奔来跑去好像要
You're running around like you have to right

347
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,620
-拯救世界  -好吧
- every wrong in the world. - Okay.

348
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,890
你总是很愤怒
You're so angry.

349
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,390
好吧  不如这样
Fine. You know what?

350
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,400
我是个刻薄鬼  而且我生气了
I'm a mean guy and I'm pissed off.

351
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,400
但马上有场暴屎雨要来袭  亲爱的
But it is a shit storm out here, sweetie.

352
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,780
你根本不知道人们都在搞什么鬼
You have no idea the kind of crap people are pulling.

353
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,760
而他们都像
And everyone's walking

354
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,530
恩雅的MV里那样走来走去
around like they're in a goddamn Enya video.

355
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,700
他们都要完蛋了
They're all getting screwed, you know.

356
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,900
你知道他们在乎什么吗
You know what they care about?

357
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,370
他们只关心球赛
They care about the ballgame.

358
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,330
或者哪个女演员进了戒毒所
Or they care about what actress just went into rehab.

359
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,460
我觉得你该试试药物治疗
I think you should try medication.

360
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,730
不行  我们已经达成一致了
No, no. We agreed.

361
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,710
那会影响工作
If it interfered with work.

362
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,650
你讨厌华尔街  或许是时候退出了
You hate Wall Street. Maybe it's time to quit.

363
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,090
-我爱我的工作  -你讨厌你的工作
- I love my job. - You hate your job.

364
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,180
我爱我的工作
I love my job.

365
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,220
你真可怜
You're miserable.

366
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,490
我爱我的工作
I love my job.

367
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,320
我爱我的工作  亲爱的
I love my job, honey.

368
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,570
马克
Mark...

369
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,850
我每天都为发生的事情悲伤
I am sad every day about what happened.

370
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,470
我知道你也是这种感觉
I know you must feel the same,

371
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,290
只是从没表现出来
but you never show it.

372
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,050
我知道你跟哥哥关系有多好
I know how close you were to your brother.

373
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,510
保罗
Paul.

374
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,180
你去哪儿了  保罗
Where'd you go, Paul?

375
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,690
保罗
Paul!

376
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,110
我每天都以为你会跟我谈  可你从没有
Every day I think you're gonna talk about it, but you never do.

377
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,730
你能否至少考虑一下做点改变
Will you at least think about the idea of making a change?

378
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,650
好吧  亲爱的  我会考虑的
Fine. Fine. Honey, you know what? I will consider it.

379
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,910
但说实话  辛西娅
But, honestly, Cynthia.

380
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,110
我没事  真的
I'm okay. I really am.

381
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,150
不行
No, no.

382
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,620
这是我的出租车
My cab. That's my cab.

383
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,610
我的出租车
That's my cab. That is my cab.

384
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,280
-白痴  滚蛋  -滚蛋
- Schmuck. Fuck you. - Fuck you.

385
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,870
-滚蛋  -滚蛋
- Fuck you. - Fuck you.

386
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,550
我待会儿打给你
I'll call you later.

387
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,010
我想买抵押债券的掉期
I want to buy swaps on mortgage bonds.

388
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,440
一种信用违约的掉期  如果相关债券违约
A credit default swap that will pay off

389
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,990
我将得到收益
if the underlying bond fails.

390
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,310
你想反赌房地产市场吗
You want to bet against the housing market?

391
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,350
-是的  -为什么
- Yes. - Why?

392
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,600
只有当上百万美国人
Those bonds only fail

393
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,150
都不偿付房贷  这些债券才会违约
if millions of Americans don't pay their mortgages.

394
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,650
这在历史上还从未发生
That's never happened in history.

395
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,800
希望你不要介意  柏利博士
If you'll excuse me, Dr. Burry,

396
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,650
这看上去是笔愚蠢的投资
it seems like a foolish investment.

397
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,490
基于流行文化中
Well, based on prevailing sentiment

398
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,610
对市场和银行的主流态度
of the market and banks in popular culture,

399
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,990
没错  这确实是笔愚蠢的投资
yes, it's a foolish investment.

400
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,590
但  所有人都错了
But, uh... everyone's wrong.

401
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,680
这说法不错
That's a good one.

402
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,670
这可是华尔街  柏利博士
This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry.

403
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,710
如果你要送钱上门  我们自然会接受
If you offer us free money, we are going to take it.

404
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:55,440
我只担心一点  等债券崩盘的时候
My one concern is that when the bonds fail,

405
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:00,100
我需要确定能得到款项支付
uh, I want to be certain, um, of payment

406
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,950
以防贵银行没有偿付能力
um, in case of solvency issues with your bank.

407
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,310
抱歉  你是说真的吗
I'm sorry, are you for real?

408
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,150
你打算反赌房地产市场
You wanna bet against the housing market

409
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,440
而且担心我们不会给你钱
and you're worried we won't pay you?

410
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,120
没错  我是这个意思
Yes, that's correct.

411
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,340
...除非市场崩溃
... unless the market crashes.

412
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,660
房地产市场不可能崩盘
The market on housing's never gonna crash

413
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,540
因为它现在非常坚挺
because it's so solid right now.

414
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,390
我是说  谁会不还房贷呢
I mean, who doesn't pay their mortgages?

415
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,450
柏利博士  我们可以设计一套
Dr. Burry, we could work out

416
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,060
即时支付的结构
a pay-as-we-go structure

417
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,140
只要债券跌价立即支付
that would pay out if the bonds fail.

418
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,570
但如果抵押债券涨价
But it would also apply to your

419
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,770
那么你也要付我们钱
payments if the value of the mortgage bond goes up.

420
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,560
你要按月支付我们溢价
You'd have to pay us monthly premiums.

421
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,370
可以接受吗  柏利博士
Is that acceptable, Dr. Burry?

422
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,170
可以  好的
Yes. Yes.

423
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,570
这里有六家住房抵押贷款支持证券的
Um, I have prospectuses on six

424
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,550
募股文件  我想做空它们

425
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,770
这些房贷大部分...
Majority of the mortgages...

426
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:24,600
我看我们根本不可能亏钱
I don't see us losing any money on these at all.

427
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,740
柏利博士  这样就可以了
Dr. Burry, these should be fine.

428
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,740
我们打算卖你五百万美元
Yeah. We're prepared to sell you $5 million

429
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,720
这些抵押债券的信用违约掉期
in credit default swaps on these mortgage bonds.

能卖一个亿吗
Can we make it $100 million?

431
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,600
当然可以卖一个亿
Uh, absolutely, we can make it $100 million.

432

我们会再联系  送一些文件过来
We'll be in touch, send some paperwork over.

他们该给我那个蠢货助理分10%
They should have paid 10% to my fuckstick assistant.

605
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,790
他叫杰瑞德·温尼特  温尼特
His name was Jared Vennett. Vennett.

606
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:48,130
德意志银行的杰瑞德·温尼特
Jared Vennett from Deutsche.

607
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:48,710
听着就很肤浅
Sounded very sketchy.

608
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,810
听起来像个蠢货
Sounds like a douchebag.

609
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,420
你闻到了吗
Do you smell that?

610
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,850
你闻到了吗
Do you smell that?

611
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,230
我闻到钱的味道
I smell money.

612
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,440
这就是你们的基本抵押贷款
This is your basic mortgage...

613
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,410
好的  你好
Okay, hi. How are you?

614
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,140
请坐
Have a seat.

615
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,380
好的  德意志银行的温尼特先生
Okay, Mr. Vennett from Deutsche Bank.

616
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:07,990
有什么
What do we have?

617
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,120
给你
There you go.

618
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,110
你跟多少人谈过这笔交易
So, how many people have you talked to about this trade?

619
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,950
有那么几个  好几个都感兴趣
A few. There's definitely some interest.

620
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,450
-不行  -老板会收拾我
- No! - My boss would have my ass...

621
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,950
-不行  -你疯了吗  杰瑞德
- N.O.! - You crazy, Jared?

622
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,600
-你疯了  -滚蛋
- Get lost. - Fuck you.

623
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,120
所以你就来找我们谈  打错的电话
Which is why you're here talking to us, a wrong number.

624
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,630
听起来确实很多人感兴趣
Sounds like there's a lot of interest.

625
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,050
好吧  有些人请我们来
All right. A few people have invited us in

626
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,510
就是想笑话这笔交易  你们也是吗
just to laugh at me on this deal. Is that you?

627
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,590
就为了笑话我吗
Is that what this is?

628
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,720
不是的
That's not what this is.

629
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,590
只是马克想这样
That's just how Mark is.

630
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,970
-说说你的想法  -抱歉
- Let's see what you got. - I'm sorry.

631
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,740
你闻到了吗  那是什么
You smell that? What is that?

632
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,280
-什么  -那是什么味道
- What? - What's that smell?

633
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,680
你的古龙水
Your cologne?

634
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,830
不是
No.

635
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,370
机遇
Opportunity.

636
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,770
不  是钱
No. Money.

637
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,150
好吧
Okay.

638
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,790
-我闻到钱的味道  -好吧
- I smell money. - Okay.

639
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,960
-克里斯  见鬼  -抱歉
- Chris, God damn it. - Sorry.

640
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,580
这就是你们的基本抵押债券
This is your basic mortgage bond.

641
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,910
好吧  一开始很简单
All right? The originals were simple.

642
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,660
就是上千笔AAA级抵押贷款捆绑起来
They were just thousands of AAA mortgages bundled together,

643
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,500
由美国政府担保
guaranteed by the U.S. Government.

644
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,420
现代的却不一样了
The modern ones are different.

645
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,440
都是私人的  由各级别贷款打包而成
They're private. And they're made up of layers of tranches.

646
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:23,000
{\an7}{\pos(39,165)}tranche是一个法语词
表示"东西的一部分"

647
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,100
最上面一级  AAA  最先给付
The highest level, AAA, is getting paid first.

648
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,170
最低级  B级  最后给付
The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last,

649
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,350
最先承担违约
taking on defaults first.

650
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,100
很明显  如果你买B级就可以赚更多钱
Now, obviously, if you're buying B's, you could make more money.

651
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,350
但有些风险
But they're a little risky.

652
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,620
有时它们会违约
Sometimes they fail.

653
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,210
克里斯
Chris?

654
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,280
到某个时候  这些B级和BB级
Somewhere along the line, these B's and BB's

655
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,820
就从有一点风险
went from a little risky

656
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,330
变成了狗屎  垃圾箱在哪儿
to dog shit. Where's the trash?

657
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,430
就在你身后
It's right behind you.

658
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,660
我指的是信贷评分的最低分
I'm talking rock-bottom FICO scores.

659
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,380
无需收入证明
No income verification.

660
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,440
浮动利率  狗屁
Adjustable rates. Dog shit!

661
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,720
违约率已经从一个百分点上升到了四个
The default rates are already up from 1% to 4%, fellas.

662
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,030
如果升到八个  肯定会升到八个
And if they rise to 8%, and they will,

663
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,060
这些评级BBB的债券就会一文不值
a lot of these BBB's are going to zero, too.

664
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,570
这  你离太近了
And that... You're too close.

665
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,310
这就是机遇
...is an opportunity.

666
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,350
好吧
Okay.

667
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,500
你是说违约率达到8%债券就会崩盘
You're saying that at 8% the bonds fail

668
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,060
现在已经4%了吗
and we are already at 4%?

669
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,150
对
That's right.

670
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,030
达到8%  世界末日就来临了
If they go to 8%, it's Armageddon?

671
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,130
对  是这样
Yeah. That's right.

672
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,960
为什么没人谈起过
How come nobody's talking about this?

673
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,200
你确定没有算错
You're completely sure of the math?

674
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,870
看看他  他是我的宽客
Look at him. That's my quant.

675
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,990
你的什么
Your what?

676
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,870
我的计量金融师
My quantitative!

677
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,640
我的数学专家  好好看看
My math specialist. Look at him.

678
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,080
发现特别之处了吗  看他的脸就知道
You notice anything different about him? Look at his face.

679
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,210
这也太种族主义了
That's pretty racist.

680
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,800
看他精明的双目  给你个提示
Look at his eyes! I'll give you a hint.

681
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,440
他姓杨
His name's Yang!

682
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,890
他在中国拿过全国数学联赛冠军
He won a national math competition in China!

683
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,470
他甚至不会说英语
He doesn't even speak English!

684
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,240
我确定没算错
Yeah, I'm sure of the math.

685
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,730
其实我姓姜  而且我会说英语
Actually, my name's Jiang and I do speak English.

686
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,980
杰瑞德喜欢说我不会
Jared likes to say I don't

687
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,190
因为他觉得这显得我的计算更加可信
because he thinks it makes me seem more authentic.

688
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,830
而且我在全国数学联赛拿的是亚军
And I got second in that national math competition.

689
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,470
所以你要提供给我们机会做空这堆积木
So you're offering us a chance to

690
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,280
怎么实施
short this pile of blocks? How?

691
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,830
利用信用违约掉期
With something called a credit default swap.

692
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,620
就好比债券的保险  如果崩盘
It's like insurance on the bond, and if it goes bust

693
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,870
你可以获利十倍  甚至二十倍
you can make 10-to-1, even 20-to-1 return.

694
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,100
现在崩盘已经在悄然发生
And it's already slowly going bust!

695
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,420
十倍  二十倍  不可能
10-to-1? 20-to-1? No way.

696
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,480
没有人会注意到
And no one's paying attention.

697
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,380
没有人在意
No one is paying attention!

698
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,930
因为银行正忙着卖这些债券
Because the banks are too busy getting paid obscene fees

699
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,310
好赚黑心钱
to sell these bonds.

700
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,140
等等  你就是银行的  你为银行工作
But wait. You are the bank. You work for the bank.

701
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,270
你的提成应该很有油水吧
I bet your margins are pretty nice and fat.

702
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,650
我们不谈我的提成
Let's not talk about my margins, by the way.

703
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,770
有油水  真是顶高帽子
Being nice and fat, that's a nice shirt. Do they make it for men?

704
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,110
你不是银行的人吗
Aren't you the bank?

705
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,110
我在银行工作  但是我有不同的想法
I work for the bank. I don't think like a bank.

706
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:51,070
不管大银行小银行  都是为了赚钱对吧
Big bank, small bank, I like to make money. All right?

707
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,120
这么说吧
Let me put it this way.

708
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,890
我站在着火的房子面前
I'm standing in front of a burning house...

709
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,750
问你买不买火险
and I'm offering you fire insurance on it.

710
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,350
这些相关债券真像你说的那么糟糕
How can these underlying bonds be as bad as you say?

711
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,670
这不合法吧
It wouldn't be legal.

712
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,710
没人知道内部情况
Nobody knows what's in them.

713
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,300
没人知道这些债券包括了哪些资产
Nobody knows what's in the bonds.

714
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,470
我见过一些含有65%AAA资产的债券
I've seen some that are 65% AAA-rated

715
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:10,510
其实内部95%都由
that I know for a fact are filled with 95%

716
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,400
信贷评分低于550的次贷垃圾充数
subprime shit with FICOs below 550!

717
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,970
滚出去
Get the fuck out of here.

718
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,430
看来你们还不够吃惊
You want me to really blow your mind?

719
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,790
当一款债券被认为风险太高时
When the market deems a bond too risky to buy,

720
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,350
你觉得我们怎么处理
what do you think we do with it?

721
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,560
猜猜看
Take a guess.

722
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,060
不知道  你告诉我
I don't know. You tell me.

723
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,070
你当我们只是书面上入个库  其实不然
All right. You think we just warehouse it on the books? No.

724
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,070
我们把一堆这样卖不掉的烂债券
We just repackage it with a bunch of other shit

725
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,260
重新包装成担保债务凭证
that didn't sell and put it into a CDO.

726
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,130
-担保债务凭证  -没错
- A CDO? - Yes. A CDO.

727
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,530
那是什么
What is that?

728
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,660
我们会把卖不出的B级
This is where we take a bunch of B's,

729
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,910
BB级和BBB级的债券
BB's and BBB's that haven't sold,

730
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,680
堆在一起
and we put them in a pile.

731
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,190
堆得足够多了
And when the pile gets large enough,

732
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,840
看起来就极具多样性了
the whole thing is suddenly considered diversified

733
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,870
{\an8}德意志银行

734
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,200
评级机构的混蛋们就把它评为
and the whores at the rating agency give it

735
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,630
含有92%到93%AAA级资产的债券
a 92%-93% AAA rating,

736
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,740
没有人怀疑
no questions asked.

737
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,910
等等  什么  再说一遍
Hold it. What? Say that again.

738
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,440
担保债务凭证
A collateralized debt obligation.

739
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,020
这是很重要的概念
It's important to understand because it's what allowed

740
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,230
因为它会让房地产危机成为全国金融危机
a housing crisis to become a nationwide economic disaster.

741
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,540
让世界名厨安东尼·伯尔顿来为你解释
Here's world-famous chef Anthony Bourdain to explain.

742
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,800
我是个厨师  周日下午
Okay, I'm a chef on a Sunday afternoon

743
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,640
正在大餐馆定着菜单
setting the menu at a big restaurant.

744
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,200
我周五订了鱼
I ordered my fish on Friday,

745
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,010
就好比是迈克尔·柏利做空的抵押债券
which is the mortgage bond that Michael Burry shorted.

746
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,210
但有些新鲜的鱼没卖掉
But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell.

747
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,580
我也不知道为什么  也许是因为
I don't know why. Maybe it just

748
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,670
大比目鱼和海豚一样聪明
came out halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin.

749
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,460
那我怎么办呢
So, what am I going to do?

750
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,050
把没卖掉的鱼  就好比是BBB级债券
Throw all this unsold fish, which is the BBB level of the bond,

751
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,610
全部扔掉  承受损失吗
in the garbage and take the loss?

752
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,560
我不干
No way.

753
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,060
我是个狡猾的道德包袱又重的厨师
Being the crafty and morally onerous chef that I am,

754
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,830
不管什么卖不掉的坏食材
whatever crappy levels of the bond I don't sell,

755
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,900
我都丢进炖海鲜里
I throw into a seafood stew.

756
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,400
它们不再是不新鲜的鱼肉  是崭新的菜
See, it's not old fish. It's a whole new thing!

757
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,200
你吃的其实是捕上来三天的大比目鱼
And the best part is they're eating 3-day-old halibut.

758
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,960
这就是担保债务凭证
That is a CDO.

759
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:56,910
我想知道  这些债券是怎么过审的
I just need to know, how could these possibly be collated?

760
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,410
你就像爱冒险的朵拉一样
Somehow you're like Dora the Explorer

763
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,160
等等  先别吵
Hold on. Hold on.

764
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,120
你是不是说抵押债券是骗人把戏
So mortgage bonds are dog shit,

765
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,420
担保债务凭证是包装过的骗人把戏
CDOs are dog shit wrapped in cat shit.

766
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,800
是的  就是这样
Yeah, that's right.

767
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,110
各大机构对于担保债务凭证的态度
Institutions treat these

768
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,380
就好像他们如国库券一般稳健
CDOs like they're as solid as treasury bonds,

769
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,720
但他们就要坍塌了
and they're going to zero.

770
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,140
这不可能  单单去年
No. That can't be right. There were $500 billion

771
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,570
就有五千亿的房地产债券售出
in housing bonds sold last year alone.

772
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,480
你是说评级机构  银行和狗屁政府
The rating agencies, the banks, the fucking government,

773
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,560
都坐视不管吗
you're saying they're all asleep at the wheel?

774
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,120
是的  我在的部门一直都是这样干的
Yeah. My whole department's long on this stuff.

775
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,880
他们叫我小鸡仔  叫我泡沫男孩
They call me Chicken Little. They call me Bubble Boy.

776
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,970
A级的崩溃了  B级的也崩溃了
A's, zero. B's, zero.

777

BB评级和BBB评级的都崩溃了
BB's, zero. BBB's, zero.

778
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,290
然后那件事就发生了
And then that happens.

779
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,060
什么事
What is that?

780
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,650
倒塌的正是美国房地产市场
That's America's housing market.

781
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,630
谢谢
Thank you.

-一起出去玩  -好的
- ...hang out with you. - Good. Okay.

785
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,310
鼓起勇气来做  我们可以成为朋友
Sack up, do the deal. Let's be friends.

786
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,600
我们再考虑考虑  谢谢
We will see. Thank you.

-别跟我说这些客套话  -好吧
- Don't bullshit me. - All right.

788
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,910
你要拒绝了  是吗
You're gonna say no, aren't you?

789
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,480
不是  我只是在权衡
No. No, I'm just evaluating right now.

790
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,290
谢谢你来和我们说
Thank you. Thank you for coming in.

791
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,710
再见  杰瑞德
Bye, Jared.

792
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,180
我不喜欢他说的
I don't like it.

793
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,800
他在耍我们
He's playing us.

794
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,750
他在耍我们  他太会表演了
He's playing us. He's got too much skin in the game

795
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,520
甚至背弃了自己的职位
and he's dumping his position.

796
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,960
万一他说得对呢
What if he's right?

797
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,130
你希望他是对的
You want him to be right.

798
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,770
我当然希望
Yes, I do.

799
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,430
银行收我们25%的信用卡利率
The banks have given us 25% interest rates on credit cards.

800
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,220
学生贷款也压榨我们
They have screwed us on student loans

801
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,050
让我们永远在底层不能翻身
that we can never get out from under.

802
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,350
然后这个人进来和我说
Then this guy walks into my office and says

803
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,390
那些银行太贪心  背离了市场
those same banks got greedy, they lost track of the market,

804
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:50,520
而我则可以从他们的愚蠢中获利
and I can profit off of their stupidity?

805
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,860
我真他妈希望他是对的
Fuck, yeah, I want him to be right!

806
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,190
你怎么都不讨厌他
How come you don't hate this guy?

807
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,940
他是你教我们不要信任的典型啊
He's everything you taught us not to trust.

808
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,740
我讨厌不起来  他对于自己的利益
I can't hate him. He is so transparent

809
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,200
非常坦诚  我甚至有点敬佩他
in his self-interest that I kind of respect him.

810
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,380
如果是从他那买车  那我肯定不干
Would I buy a car from him? No.

811
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,870
但是他对房贷市场的分析对不对
Is he right about the mortgage market?

812
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,180
-不对  -我们研究研究
- No. - Let's find out. Let's find out.

813
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,580
这是两个很简单的问题
Look. It's two very simple questions.

814
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,170
房地产泡沫存在吗
Is there a housing bubble?

815
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,840
如果存在  银行面临多大的危机
And if there is, how exposed are the banks?

816
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,960
好吧
Yeah. Okay.

817
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,470
我们也要马上行动
Let's get on this quickly too.

818
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,930
因为如果他是对的
Because if he's right,

819
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,490

当然  我们现在有三千万
Of course. We're doing $30 million right now.

851
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,790
但是四年前刚起步的时候只有十一万
Um, but we started four years ago with $110,000.

852
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,340
所以你也能看得出  效益很显著
So, as you can see, that's pretty phenomenal returns.

853
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,650
我们想和摩根大通签订ISDA协议

天啊  他说投资基于信用违约掉期的
Shit, he's saying that there's 10-to-1 returns

898
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,730
住房抵押贷款支持证券可以带来十倍的收益
on credit default swaps for mortgage-backed securities?

899
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,480
而且整个房地产市场就要崩溃了
And the whole housing market is about to collapse?

900
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,920
对于杰米和查理来说
For Jamie and Charlie, the housing market

901
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,430
房地产市场末日的预言如同音乐一般悦耳
doomsday prediction was music to their ears.

902
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:55,830
快乐只因今日寻得挚友  于我心中
I'm so happy, coz today I found my friend, they're in my head.

903
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,020
他们起初在杰米的车库里创业时
They had started working out of Jamie's garage

904
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,020
用的是杰米驾驶帆船往返东岸
with $110,000 Jamie had saved

905
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,210
积攒下的十一万美元
taking sailboats up and down the East Coast.

906
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,900
我们的投资方案很简单
Our investment strategy was simple.

907
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,030
人们不愿预想坏事的发生
People hate to think about bad things happening,

908
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,450
所以他们总是会低估发生的可能性
so they always underestimate their likelihood.

909
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,050
他们的方案简单而精明
Their strategy was simple and brilliant.

910
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,660
正如他所说
What he said.

911
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,460
杰米和查理发现市场愿以极低的价格出售
Jamie and Charlie found markets will sell options very cheaply

912
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,750
自认为不可能发生的事情的期权
on things they think will never happen.

913
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,420
所以如果他们错了  损失也不大
So when they were wrong, they were wrong small,

914
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,460
但如果是对的  就能大赚一笔
but when they were right, they were right big.

915
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,060
几年内他们就把十一万变成了三千万
Within a few years they had turned $110,000 into $30 million.

916
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,810
然后他们就去了纽约
But then it was time to go to New York City.

917
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,520
但到现在为止  进展不太好
And so far, it wasn't going very well.

918
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,350
如果真的有利可图呢
So what if it does seem interesting. No...

919
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,190
没有银行愿意和我们签ISDA协议
No bank will give us our ISDA.

920
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,960
我们没救了
We're dead in the water.

921
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,860
这些交易完全做不起来
These kind of trades are totally out of the question.

922
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,590
我们可以给本打电话
We got to call Ben.

923

我们给本打电话吧
Let's call Ben!

本·瑞科特曾在大通银行新加坡分部当交易员
Ben Rickert was a former trader in Singapore

925
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,080
后来厌恶了这一切  退出了金融业
for Chase who quit the whole game in disgust.

926
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,500
他是杰米住在科罗拉多时的邻居
He happened to be Jamie's neighbor when they were in Colorado

927
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,750
二人的相遇缘于遛狗
and they met walking dogs.

928
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,310
但本很悲观
But Ben was dark.

929
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,460
他不仅觉得整个系统会崩溃
He didn't just think the whole system would fail.

他觉得整个世界都会沦陷

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,130
你现在做空的仓位有多少
How big is your short position right now?

1046
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,220
只有十三亿
Just $1.3 billion.

1047
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,180
溢价呢
And the premiums?

1048
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:34,640
我们每年
Well, we pay, uh,

1049
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,440
大概要付八千到九千万
roughly $80 to 90 million

1050
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,000
虽然有点高
each year, which is high,

1051
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,170
但是我是第一个做这种交易的人
but I was the first to do this trade.

1052
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,940
等着瞧吧  肯定会赚回来的
Watch. It will pay.

1053
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,720
我可能下手有点早  但是我没做错
I may have been early, but I'm not wrong.

1054
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,150
没有区别  根本没有区别  迈克
It's the same thing. It's the same thing, Mike!

1055
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:53,120
你管理的基金有差不多5.5亿吧
You're managing a fund of, what, $555 million?

1056
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:57,160
用不了六年就都没了
In six years, it'll all be gone.

1057
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,360
只在这一项赌注上
On one bet.

1058
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,510
不会的  等到2007年第二季度
No, the second quarter

1059
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,630
浮动利率开始执行的时候
of '07 is when the adjustable rates kick in.

1060
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,240
违约率就会飞涨
The defaults will skyrocket.

1061
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,030
是啊  只有你这么说
Yeah. Says you.

1062
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,570
在那之前有多少可以赎回
How much is eligible for withdrawal before they do?

1063
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,590
我是说下两个季度
Say, in the next two quarters.

1064
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,300
如果你的投资人恐慌了
If your investors panic.

1065
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,880
3.2亿吧
$302 million?

1066
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,980
我...
I...

1067
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,480
我的天哪  迈克
My God, Mike.

1068
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,220
没有人会撤资的  那相当于自杀
No one will pull out. That would be suicide.

1069
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,740
我是说  今年我已经赔了17%了
I mean, I'm down 17% for the year.

1070
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,140
但如果他们相信我  他们确实信我  因为
But if they trust me, and they trust me, because...

1071
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,850
没有人相信你  没有人
No one trusts you! No one!

1072
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,370
我给投资人们发了几封邮件
I sent several emails to my investors

1073
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,540
让他们知道
letting them know that the...

1074
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,590
等到2007年第二季度
...the second quarter of '07 is when our

1075
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:47,170
我们在房地产上的投资就会看到回报了
housing positions show returns and...

1076
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,800
我说得非常清楚
I've been very clear.

1077
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:53,430
他们会撤资的
People will withdraw their money.

1078
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,460
劳伦斯  那样做就太蠢了  我是说
Lawrence, that would be so stupid. I mean, the...

1079
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,060
如果基金资本流失过多
If the fund's capitals drop too much,

1080
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,590
掉期就会失效
then the swaps contracts are voided.

1081
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:07,930
银行会拿走全部的抵押物
And then the banks get to keep all of the collateral.

1082
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,240
-等一下  -所有的抵押物
- Wait a minute. Wait. - All of it.

1083
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,470
合同会自动失效
The contracts are voided?

1084
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,360
合同会自动失效
The contracts are voided?

1085
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,740
他妈的
Holy shit!

1086
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,200
你这个畜生
Oh, motherfucker!

1087
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,370
迈克尔
Michael?

1088
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,410
把我的钱还给我
Give me my money back.

1089
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:29,210
迈克尔  你听到了吗  我要你还钱
Michael, do you hear me? I want my money back.

1090
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,050
把我的钱他妈的还给我
Give me my fucking money back...

1091
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,510
你这个混蛋
...you motherfucker.

1092
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,560
市场目前正处于一个小低谷中
The market's in an itsy-bitsy little gully right now.

1093
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,920
就像大家说的  "好像有点太疯狂了"
It's like everybody said, "Okay, that was crazy."

1094
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,900
"那就先冷静一下吧"
"Let's just all calm down."

1095
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,940
那栋房子刚建好那年我把它卖了35万
I sold that house for $350,000 the year it was built.

1096
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:52,780
两年之后  它值48万
Two years later, $480,000.

1097
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,070
一年半之前是58.5万
Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.

1098
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,740
这对夫妻去年花了65万买下了它
This couple bought it for $650,000 last year.

1099
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,060
看现在的情况  他不得不出手了
He'd let it go for that.

1100
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,810
约翰
Hi, John.

1101
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:03,960
不  不用
No, no, no.

1102
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,960
虽然非常心疼  但他还是会出手的
It will break his heart, but he'll let it go.

1103
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,820
他为什么要卖掉房子
Why is he selling?

1104
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,750
他们夫妻俩现在都没工作
Neither one's working right now.

1105
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,370
玛琳  你是说他们有卖房的理由是吗
Marlene, you'd say they're motivated, right?

1106
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,450
跟这附近其他人的理由一样充分
As motivated as one can be in this neighborhood.

1107
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,080
左边这家  我觉得他们也可能很积极
This house on the left, I would say they're probably motivated.

1108
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,120
天啊  看起来积极卖房的人不少啊
Wow, a lot of people seem very motivated.

1109
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,310
这只是个小低谷
Oh, it's just the gully.

1110
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,330
就这样  没什么
That's all. Just...

1111
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:25,840
大家只是有点紧张
Just nerves.

1112
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,650
那么我们要去看哪一家
So where do we stand?

1113
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,300
我还得跟我太太商量商量
I need to talk to my wife. Um...

1114
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,680
市场不会一直这样的
This market won't last.

1115
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,550
我能找个房贷经纪人谈谈吗
Actually, could I talk to a mortgage broker?

1116
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,470
你有认识的还不错的吗
Anybody you recommend? Anybody you like.

1117
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,560
当然  我认识几个  绝对没问题
Yes, yes, I have someone. Absolutely.

1118
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,890
那个贱人当然喜欢我了
Yeah, bitch better like me.

1119
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,240
因为我她才有钱去卡布度假
Sent her ass to Cabo.

1120
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,460
摩根斯坦利是要招募我们吗
So is Morgan Stanley recruiting us? Is that it?

1121
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,040
不是的  对冲基金的所有权属于银行
Oh, no. No. The bank owns our hedge fund,

1122
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,840
但是我们并不是银行的一部分
but we're not really part of it.

1123
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,400
我们对金融公司进行投资
We invest in financial service companies

1124
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,450
现在想了解一下住房贷款业务的情况
and we're trying to understand the residential mortgage business.

1125
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,470
你每个月能做多少笔贷款
How many loans do you write each month?

1126
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:00,120
-大概60笔吧  -没错
- About 60. - Yeah.

1127
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,680
四年前的情况呢
What was it four years ago?

1128
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,960
10笔吧
Ten...

1129
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,290
也可能是15笔
Maybe 15.

1130
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,670
我以前只是个酒保  现在我游艇都有了
Yeah, I was a bartender. Now I own a boat.

1131
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:08,710
你有一艘...
You own a...

1132
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:12,050
那这些贷款里面有多少是浮动利率的
So how many of these are adjustable-rate mortgages?

1133
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,800
-大部分都是  -是的
- Well, most. - Oh, yeah.

1134
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,840
我看90%都是浮动利率
Yeah, I'd say about 90%.

1135
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,060
在这种贷款上的提成几年前就飞涨了
The bonuses on those skyrocketed a few years ago.

1136
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,430
浮动利率就是我们的金矿
Adjustable's our bread and honey.

1137
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:23,060
那有申请被拒的情况吗
So do applicants ever get rejected?

1138
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:28,620
你没开玩笑吧
Seriously?

1139
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,570
如果有申请被拒了  那我就不称职了
Look, if they get rejected, I suck at my job.

1140
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,150
即使他们没钱也没问题
Even if they have no money?

1141
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,110
我的公司提供"忍者"贷款
Well, my firm offers NINJA loans.

1142
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:38,680
"没收入  没工作"
"No Income, No Job."

1143
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,200
我把收入那一栏空着就好了
I just leave the income section blank if I want.

1144
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,540
公司不介意这个的
Corporate doesn't care.

1145
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,920
这些人就想有个住的地方  就顺其自然了
These people just want homes. And they go with the flow.

1146
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,000
你们真行
Good for you.

1147
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,140
你们的公司不去核实他们的财务状况吗
Your companies don't verify?

1148
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,260
如果我周五下午签下一笔贷款
If I write a loan on Friday afternoon,

1149
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,740
周一早上就会有大银行把它买走
a big bank will buy it by Monday lunch.

1150
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,610
是的  我这里也差不多
Yeah. Same here.

1151
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,780
能失陪一下吗
Could you hold on a second?

1152
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,280
当然
Yeah.

1153
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,610
我不明白  他们为什么这么坦白
I don't get it. Why are they confessing?

1154
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,670
他们这不是坦白
They're not confessing.

1155
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,460
他们是在吹牛
They're bragging.

1156
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:28,230
他们清楚这些贷款的风险吗
Do people have any idea what they are buying?

1157
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,420
我的客户主要是移民  你懂的
I focus on the immigrants, you know.

1158
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,130
只要他们想买房
Once they find out they're getting a home,

1159
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,590
给什么他们都会签的
they sign where you tell them to sign.

1160
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,800
没有疑问  也不理解利率
Don't ask questions. Don't understand the rates.

1161
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,340
-都是他妈的傻逼  -没错
- Fucking idiots. - Yeah.

1162
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,850
你也主要做移民的生意吗
And you target immigrants, too?

1163
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,780
移民的信用对他来说还不够糟呢
Well, their credit actually isn't bad enough for him.

1164
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,370
我不是个跟钱过不去的人
Look, I'm a yield guy.

1165
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:47,910
是这样...
Okay...

1166
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,920
在一笔固定利率的优质房贷上
I make $2,000

1167
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,400
我只能赚两千美元
on a fixed-rate prime loan, right?

1168
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,110
但在浮动利率的次贷上我能赚一万美元
But I can make $10,000 on a subprime adjustable.

1169
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:56,850
相信我
Trust me,

1170
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:59,160
没有脱衣舞娘我现在也开不上宝马7系了
I'm not driving a 7 Series without strippers.

1171
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,530
脱衣舞娘的信用普遍不高  但是现金充足
No one on the pole has good credit and they're all cash rich.

1172
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:04,970
我记得沃伦·巴菲特也说过这样的话
I think I read Warren Buffett say something like that.

1173
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,720
什么  谁是沃伦·巴菲特
What? Who's Warren Buffett?

1174
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,960
你说脱衣舞娘  那种异域舞者吗
Okay, so strippers. Like exotic dancers?

1175
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,250
对  对  对
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1176
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,300
一丝不挂的那种
Nude, you know, topless.

1177
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,230
-一丝不挂的脱衣舞娘  -没错
- Strippers. - Yeah.

1178
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,010
你能给我们介绍一个吗
Can you introduce us?

1179
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,510
当然  没问题
Yes! Yes.

1180
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,550
我总是申请选择性还款的浮动利率贷款
I always get option-pay adjustables.

1181
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:28,520
我是个自由职业者
I'm a private contractor.

1182
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,270
不好意思  我听不见你说什么
What? I can't hear you. I'm sorry.

1183
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:32,190
我总是申请选择性还款的浮动利率贷款
I always get option-pay adjustables.

1184
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,520
我是个自由职业者  需要一些灵活性
I'm a private contractor. I need flexibility.

1185
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,190
那你告诉房贷公司你是做什么工作的
And you tell the mortgage company what you do?

1186
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,280
我的申请上写的是"治疗师"
I write "Therapist".

1187
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,840
-你可以摸我  -一直这样吗
- You can touch me. - Always?

1188
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,490
只有在VIP包房才可以
Only in V.I.P.

1189
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:45,200
不是这个  你说你总是选浮动利率贷款
No, no, no, you say you always do adjustables.

1190
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,080
你在一套房上不止一笔贷款吗
And you have more than one loan on a property?

1191
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,370
每个人都这样  至少在这里是这样
Everybody does. At least down here.

1192
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:50,460
不好意思  你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

1193
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,130
每个人都这样  至少在这里是这样
Everybody does. At least down here.

1194
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,380
这样首付只要5%
That way you only put down, like, 5%.

1195
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,260
现在房价跌了你知道吗
Prices have leveled off, though, right?

1196
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,170
是啊  只是个低谷
Yeah. There's a gully.

1197
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:02,990
你可以别晃来晃去吗  我会付你钱的
Would you mind not moving anymore? I'll still pay you.

1198
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,480
对不起  有人看着呢
Sorry. We're not alone.

1199
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,190
听我说  如果房价不涨了
Okay, look. If home prices don't go up,

1200
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,560
你就不能重新贷款了
you are not going to be able to refinance.

1201
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:17,780
等到利率优惠期一过
And you'll be stuck paying whatever your monthly payment is

1202
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,590
你就会陷入高涨的月供
once it jumps up after your teaser rate expires.

1203
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,050
月供会涨200%到300%
Your monthlies could go up 200%-300%.

1204
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,490
詹姆斯说我总是可以重新贷款的
James says I can always refinance.

1205
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,370
他就是个骗子
Well, he's a liar.

1206
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,580
其实  在这种特殊情况下  詹姆斯说错了
Actually, in this particular case, James probably is wrong.

1207
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,960
200%  我的所有贷款都这样吗
200 percent? On all my loans?

1208
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,420
你的"所有"贷款是什么意思
What do you mean "All" Your loans?

1209
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,940
我们说的是一套房子上的两笔贷款对吗
We're talking about two loans on one house, right?

1210
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,730
我有五套房子
I have five houses.

1211
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,820
还有一套公寓
And a condo.

1212
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,180
没错  绝对有泡沫
Hey, there's a bubble.

1213
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,260
你怎么知道的
How do you know?

1214
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,020
相信我  给温尼特打电话
Trust me. Call Vennett,

1215
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,770
买五千万的住房抵押贷款支持证券掉期
buy $50 million in swaps on the MBS.

1216
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,770
有什么目标  评级BBB的Garibaldi IV
What do we got? Garibaldi IV, BBB.

1217
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,360
马克  你确定吗
Mark, are you sure?

1218
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,270
当然  这些都是狗屎
Yeah. Yeah, it's time to call bullshit.

1219
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,040
-什么是狗屎  -全都是狗屎
- Bullshit on what? - Every fucking thing.

1220
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,900
FrontPoint的电话
FrontPoint! FrontPoint!

1221
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,510
是全美国最愤怒的对冲基金吗
Is this America's angriest hedge fund?

1222
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:31,740
听我说  我有一个问题要问你
All right, listen. I got one last question for you.

1223
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,740
你想怎么玩弄我们
How are you fucking us?

1224
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,110
你不用说的这么难听  维尼
There's a nicer way to say that, Vinnie.

1225
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,730
我是认真的
I'm serious.

1226
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,420
只有你说了
We'll buy your swaps,

1227
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,900
我们才会买你的掉期
but only if you say how you're fucking us.

1228
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,490
我不想玩弄你们  维尼  我想吻你们啊
I'm not fucking you, Vinnie. I'm kissing you.

1229
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:48,330
我要深情注视你的双眼跟你做爱  维尼
I'm looking deep into your eyes as I make love to you, Vinnie.

1230
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,750
我把本世纪最划算的买卖送到了你的面前
I'm handing you the deal of the century on a fucking platter.

1231
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,210
我能得到什么  很简单
What do I get out of it? Easy.

1232
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,710
我现在的业务每个月赔两千万
I got a $20-million-a-month negative carry.

1233
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,270
我的老板们早就想杀了我
I got bosses trying to pull the

1234
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,670
因为他们觉得我他妈的疯了
plug because they think I'm out of my fucking mind.

1235
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:01,760
明白吗
All right?

1236
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,920
如果我们完成这笔交易
We make this trade,

1237
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,340
这些问题就都不是问题了
those problems aren't so big anymore.

1238
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,930
当然了  掉期市场是个不透明的黑市
And sure, swaps are a dark market,

1239
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,180
所以价格我说了算
so I set the price.

1240
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,760
我想定价多少就定多少
Whatever price I want.

1241
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,280
当你们赚到钱的时候
And when you come for the payday,

1242
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,620
我会在你们身上大赚一笔
I'm gonna rip your eyes out, I'm gonna make a fortune.

1243
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,230
但是你们也不会在乎了  维尼
But the good news is, Vinnie, you're not gonna care

1244
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,520
因为你们赚的更他妈多
because you're gonna make so much fucking money.

1245
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,900
这就是我能得到的好处
That's what I get out of it.

1246
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,280
想知道你们能得到的好处吗
Want to know what you get out of it?

1247
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,860
你们会得到冰淇淋  巧克力  香蕉和坚果
You get the ice cream, the hot fudge, the banana, and the nuts.

1248
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,700
现在  我是得到了些小糖粒
Right now, I get the sprinkles, and, yeah,

1249
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,410
最后我能得到圣代顶上的那颗樱桃
if this goes through, I get the cherry.

1250
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:32,700
但是你们会得到整个圣代  维尼
But you get the sundae, Vinnie.

1251
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,470
剩下的都是你们的
You get the sundae.

1252
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:39,710
好吧  我信你  谢谢
All right, I buy that. Thank you.

1253
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,960
那怎么说
So what do you say?

1254
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,920
-你要跟我做生意吗  -好的
- You want me to make you a market? - Yeah.

1255
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,550
我们要买五千万的掉期
We'll take $50 million,

1256
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,530
评级BBB的Garibaldi IV
Garibaldi IV, BBB.

1257
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:51,030
准备好签字吧  我马上把合同弄好
Sharpen your pencils. I'll get the paperwork ready.

1258
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:55,240
操你大爷
Fuck you, too.

1259
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,700
太棒了
Yes!

1260
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,660
这就对了
That's right.

1261
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,690
天啊
Oh, man.

1262
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:10,010
他的号码太多了  我总是搞不清
He has so many numbers, and I always forget

1263
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:12,990
{\an8}{\pos(289,76)}2006年5月

1264
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,740
他喜欢用哪个  因为他太特别了
which one he prefers, because he's very specific.

1265
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,030
从第一个开始试吧
Start with the first one.

1266
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,340
我不知道第一个对不对
I don't know if it's the first one.

1267
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,750
试试就知道了
Just try it.

1268
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,390
好吧
Okay. I... Okay.

1269
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,780
-本·瑞科特  -本  我是杰米
- Ben Rickert. - Hey, Ben. It's Jamie.

1270
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,200
杰米  你知道你不应该打这个号码吧
Jamie, you know you're not supposed to use this line.

1271
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:44,920
我说什么来着
Told you.

1272
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:48,960
好吧  我们试试这14个号码里的第二个
Okay, let's try number two out of 14.

1273
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,540
这里是本·瑞科特
Ben Rickert.

1274
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,630
本  你为什么要挂电话  我是说
Ben, why do you do that, man? I mean...

1275
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,130
你退休了  没人会窃听你的电话
You're a retired trader, okay? No one is listening to your calls.

1276
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,920
国安局有520亿美元的预算
The NSA has a $52 billion budget and the ability

1277
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,380
他们每秒能窃听数百万次通话
to monitor tens of millions of calls a second.

1278
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,800
你觉得他们就放在那里不用吗
You think they're not using it?

1279
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,720
我保证不在一句话里
Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying

1280
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,990
说出本·瑞科特和"脏弹"这两个词
"Ben Rickert" And "Dirty bomb" in the same sent...

1281
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,520
-他妈的上帝啊  -不好意思  哥们
- Jesus fucking Christ. - I'm sorry, dude.

1282
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,250
本·瑞科特
Ben Rickert.

1283
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,730
你有没有看我们发给你的资料  本
Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben?

1284
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,000
是查理在讲话  我也在这里
It's Charlie. I'm here, too.

1285
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,090
你好查理  我看了  你等等
Hi, Charlie. Yeah, I did. Hold on.

1286
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:38,180
本  你还在吗
Ben, you still there?

1287
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,430
我在
Yeah.

1288
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,210
先生们  我实话实说
I'll be honest, gentlemen.

1289
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,230
我被吓到了
It scared the shit out of me.

1290
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,710
但这是好事  对吧
But that's a good thing, right?

1291
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,610
说明这个叫温尼特的人没说错
That means this Vennett guy's not wrong.

1292
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,400
是的  他没错
No, he's not.

1293
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,090
那好
Cool.

1294
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,760
和我多说点相关信息
Tell me more about these CDOs.

1295
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,620
好  温尼特提到这些债务担保凭证
Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, you know, Vennett mentions the CDOs,

1296
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,010
但事实上  我们看过以后
but actually, we took a look

1297
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:02,990
事情比他意识到的要糟得多
and they're way worse than even he realizes.

1298
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,520
这些数据根本说不通
These things don't make any sense!

1299
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,860
我们甚至无法建立模型
We can't even model them.

1300
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,650
它的数量比房贷证券要大100倍
These are 100 times bigger than the MBS.

1301
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,320
90%为AAA评级
And 90% AAA-rated.

1302
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,170
-是啊  -超过90%
- Yes! Exactly! - Over 90%.

1303
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,360
你们挺厉害
It's incredible.

1304
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,630
我仔细看了你们想做空的这些担保凭证
I took a good hard look at the CDOs you want to short.

1305
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,800
它们就是外秀内中  彻头彻尾的垃圾
They're brilliant. Worthless. Total crap.

1306
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,620
杰米  干得漂亮
Jamie. Very good.

1307
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,210
怎么说呢  找垃圾投资我还挺有天赋的
What can I say? I'm good at finding shit.

1308
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:29,050
那么本  我们把BB和BBB级别的做空
So, Ben, we shorted the BB's and the BBB's,

1309
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,210
然后风险也相对比较小
and the risk is relatively low.

1310
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,980
-回报率大概是25倍  -是的
- Payoff is, like, 25-to-1. - Yeah.

1311
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,390
你们打电话找我干啥  我早洗手不干了  
Okay, so, why are you calling me? I don't do this anymore.

1312
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:39,660
是这样的  本
Look, Ben?

1313
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,730
我们需要你帮我们拿到ISDA协议
We need you to help us get the ISDA.

1314
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,730
ISDA协议是国际掉期与衍生品协会为国际场外衍生品交易提供的标准协议文本及其附属文件。

1315
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:47,900
有了协议在手  我们才能做空
If we get a hunting license, we can short this crap.

1316
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,170
我们知道你痛恨华尔街
And we know you hate Wall Street.

1317
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:50,440
所以不会要求你替我们做交易
We're not asking you to do the trading.

1318
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:54,490
我们只是想求你帮我们弄到
We're simply asking you to help us get a seat

1319
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,740
一张开始的入场券
at the fucking table.

1320
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,740
这可不是闹着玩的
It's a pretty ugly table, guys.

1321
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,830
本  整个金融系统已经乱成一团
Look, Ben, the system fucked up in a big, big way here, okay?

1322
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:07,020
但偶然地
And somehow, uh,

1323
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,020
我们却抢先得到了消息
we know before anyone else.

1324
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:13,270
这可是千载难逢的好机会
You know? This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal.

1325
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:16,860
我在考虑
I'm thinking.

1326
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,850
好吧  我会给德意志银行打个电话
Okay. I'll call Deutsche Bank.

1327
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,190
谢谢你  本  谢谢
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.

1328
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,870
那贝尔斯登公司呢  那也有些垃圾产品
And Bear. What about Bear? They have some reprehensible product.

1329
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,540
可以  贝尔斯登肯定来者不拒
Okay. Bear will trade with anybody.

1330
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,250
欢迎来到纽约  市长迈克尔·布隆伯格

1331
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,420
我看看能不能把材料递交上去
All right. I'll see if I can push it through.

1332
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,350
谢谢你  诺亚  替我们谢谢杰瑞德
Thank you, Noah. And thank Jared for us.

1333
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:28,510
我们就不能进公司里签字吗
Couldn't we go inside?

1334
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,850
就是说
Yeah, me, too.

1335
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,120
真相如诗歌

1337
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,540
在华盛顿某酒吧无意听到的一句话

1338
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:09,080
福克斯商业新闻: 抵押贷款拖欠额度创100万新高

1339
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:14,170
2007年1月11日

1340
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:16,230
我是马克  我急需与维尼谈谈
Hi, this is Mark. I need to talk to Vinnie right now.

1341
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:19,270
我们就想让你跟我们解释一下
We're just asking you to explain to us

1342
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,430
你为什么耍我们
just how it is that you are fucking us,

1343
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,780
因为我这里看到的情况
because what we are seeing...

1344
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,990
去摩根斯坦利大厦  快
Morgan Stanley building, fast.

1345
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:31,390
我们看的是同样的数据吗
Are we hooked up to the same computer screen?

1346
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,160
这数据完全说不通
It doesn't make any sense.

1347
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,460
维尼  听得到吗
Vinnie, you there?

1348
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,860
马克  听得到吗
Mark, you there?

1349
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,900
听得到  你听说了没
Yeah, did you hear?

1350
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,740
抵押贷款拖欠额度已经破新高了
Mortgage defaults have gone through the roof.

1351
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,280
有人跳楼了吗
Is anybody jumping off of buildings yet?

1352
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,580
为什么跳楼  次贷债券的价格居高不下
Why would they? Subprime mortgage bond prices are up.

1353
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,700
什么
What?

1354
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,080
温尼特想在收市前再投入190万抵押
Vennett wants $1.9 million more in collateral by close.

1355
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,460
温尼特想让我们追加抵押
Vennett's asking us to post collateral.

1356
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,960
怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

1357
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,000
不知道  但德意志银行在电话里要求付款
We don't know, but Deutsche's on the phone demanding payment.

1358
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,920
给温尼特打电话  让这混蛋接电话
Call Vennett. Call that little shit.

1359
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,960
给温尼特打电话  叫他赶紧滚过来
Call Vennett. Tell him to get his ass down here.

1360
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,840
所以次级贷款断供了
So subprime loans go bad,

1361
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,190
但它们组成的次级贷款债券
but subprime bonds, which are

1362
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:04,140
反而升值了吗
made up of subprime loans, are more valuable?

1363
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,700
我懂  但他们让我们收市前追加190万
I know. They want another $1.9 million by market close.

1364
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,930
信用评级机构呢  穆迪公司和标普呢
What about the ratings agencies? Moody's, S&P...

1365
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:11,430
债务担保凭证和房贷债券的评级下调了吗
Are they downgrading the CDOs and mortgage bonds?

1366
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:12,600
信用评级机构的评级如何
Where are the ratings agencies at?

1367
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,200
评级保持不变
They're the fucking same.

1368
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:15,770
没变  还是AAA级
No, they're all still AAA.

1369
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,360
搞什么  你这是在逗我吗
What the hell? Are you fucking kidding me?

1370
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,530
这群混蛋  没良心的混蛋
Those fuckers! Those motherfuckers!

1371
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,730
这些评级公司一公开上市
They go public, and all they

1372
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:23,570
就只管自己的净利润
care about is their bottom line and their shit.

1373
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,410
马克  这还没完
Hey, Mark, that's not all.

1374
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,780
摩根斯坦利风险部门的人来了
The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here.

1375
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,240
他们找了陶凯茜
They called in Kathy Tao.

1376
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,450
他们想说服她卖掉咱们的掉期交易
They're trying to convince her to make us sell our swaps.

1377
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:32,790
显然  他们认为套牢六年保险费
Apparently, tying up six years of insurance payments

1378
01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:34,620
坐等房地产崩溃
in hopes of a housing Armageddon

1379
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,980
是一项不明智的投资
is not prudent investing.

1380
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,340
那凯西说了什么
What did Kathy say?

1381
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,130
还没  她一直问这是不是你的讨伐运动
Nothing yet. She keeps asking if this is one of your crusades.

1382
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,130
那好  我想让你回到那房间
Okay, I want you to walk back in there

1383
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,880
用冷静且礼貌的方式
and very calmly, very politely,

1384
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,650
让这些风险评估师都他妈滚蛋
tell the risk assessors to fuck off.

1385
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,400
然后你到标准普尔机构这和我碰面
And then meet me over at Standard & Poor's.

1386
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,010
我们找格鲁吉亚谈谈
We're gonna talk to Georgia.

1387
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,140
好的
All right. Okay.

1388
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,140
让杰瑞德·温尼特给我滚过来
Get that fuck Jared Vennett in this office.

1389
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,040
看我待会打爆他脑袋
I'm gonna bash his fucking head in.

1390
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,610
先生们
Uh, gentlemen?

1391
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:04,750
我刚和马克·鲍姆谈过了  他让你们滚蛋
I spoke with Mark Baum. He says to fuck off.

1392
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,900
百老汇大道25号  标准普尔评级机构

1393
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,900
我啥都看不清
I can't see a damn thing.

1394
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,760
我的眼科医生一直都很忙
My eye doctor's always busy.

1395
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,630
所以我只好接受任何可行的预约
I end up taking any appointment they'll give me,

1396
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:29,070
然后整个上午就这么荒废了
and then the whole morning gets shot to hell!

1397
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,740
那么
So...

1398
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,740
好的
All righty,

1399
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,620
顶尖基金公司的朋友们
FrontPoint Partners,

1400
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,520
标准普尔有什么能帮到你们吗
how can Standard & Poor's help you?

1401
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:40,860
我们不明白为什么
Well, we don't understand why

1402
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,570
评级机构还没有下调次贷债券的评级
the ratings agencies haven't downgraded subprime bonds

1403
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:46,700
因为债券对应的房贷  断供明显在恶化
since the underlying loans are clearly deteriorating.

1404
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,200
断供率确实让部分人担心了
Well, the delinquency rates do have people worried,

1405
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,080
但这波动是在我们的模型预测之内的
but they're actually within our models.

1406
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,140
-那么…  -口说无凭
- So... - Says you.

1407
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,710
你确信这些债券对应的房贷
...you're convinced the underlying mortgages

1408
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,230
是可靠的吗
in these bonds are solid loans.

1409
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,210
根据我们公司的观点  是的
That is our opinion, yes.

1410
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:03,380
你看过发放贷款的数据吗
Have you looked at the loan-level data?

1411
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,210
任何人  只要有信用评分
I mean, they're giving these loans

1412
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:06,550
都能随意拿到贷款
to anybody with a credit score and a pulse.

1413
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,220
抱歉  先生你认为我们的工作是什么
Excuse me, sir. What do you think we do here all day?

1414
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,340
我们不确定  所以才到这里来
We're not sure. That's why we're here.

1415
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,550
我不明白的是
Here's what I don't understand...

1416
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:13,360
我们再三确认过了
We check, recheck, recheck again.

1417
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:14,770
如果这些房贷债券这么稳定靠谱
If these mortgage bonds are so stable...

1418
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,560
也许你该先检查下你朋友正不正常
Perhaps you could check your friend.

1419
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:18,640
你是否有曾拒绝过
...have you ever refused to rate...

1420
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,270
-这是痴人说梦  -我们相信这些公司
- Ma'am, that's delusional. - We stand behind them.

1421
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:22,940
格鲁吉亚  你是否拒绝过给这里的
Georgia, have you ever refused to rate

1422
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:26,320
任何一家公司的AAA评级
any of these bonds upper tranches AAA?

1423
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,990
我能看看这些交易对应的材料吗
Can we see the paperwork on those deals?

1424
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,070
我没有义务与你们
I am under no obligation to share that information

1425
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:31,240
或任何人分享这些信息
with you, whoever you might be.

1426
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:33,050
回答我的问题  格鲁吉亚
Just answer the question, Georgia.

1427
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:36,540
你能给出一个去年里  经你查证后
Can you name one time in the past year where you checked the tape

1428
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,850
没能获得银行想要的AAA评级的例子吗
and you didn't give the banks the AAA percentage they wanted?

1429
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,250
如果我们不这么评
If we don't give them the ratings,

1430
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,270
他们就会去找隔壁的穆迪评级了
they'll go to Moody's, right down the block.

1431
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:50,530
若我们不配合  他们就去找我们的对手
If we don't work with them, they will go to our competitors.

1432
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,360
这不怪我们  规则就是这么定的
Not our fault. Simply the way the world works.

1433
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,200
-我的天  -现在你明白了吧
- Holy shit. - Yes, now you see.

1434
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,270
我刚才什么都没说
And I never said that.

1435
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,780
他们拿评级来卖钱
They're selling ratings for fees.

1436
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,820
像商店一样
A ratings shop.

1437
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,740
你们不缺钱  别贪心
You can afford to make less. Make less.

1438
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,700
没人这么说过
Nobody said that.

1439
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,950
而且这不是我能决定的  我有上司
And it is not my decision. I have a boss.

1440
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,390
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?

1441
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,830
我没在和你开玩笑
No, I am not "Kidding you".

1442
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,210
如果是首次上市募股  你上级会怎么做
How'd your boss do on the IPO?

1443
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,500
这就是你的立场吗
Is that the angle you're taking?

1444
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,090
-只要自己不是老板  -站着说话不腰疼
- So, now, anyone who has a boss  - You’re obviously working for yourselves then.

1445
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,920
违法都不会被追究责任吗
can't be held responsible for doing shitty and illegal things.

1446
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:27,920
你还是小孩吗
What are you, four?

1447
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,680
不  我不是四岁孩子  鲍姆先生
No, I am not four, Mr. Baum. I am not, no.

1448
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,160
我疑惑的是你们的来这的动机是什么
And I wonder what your incentives might be.

1449
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,810
是不是评级如果变了
Is it maybe in your best interest

1450
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,910
对你们有好处  是吗
to have the ratings change? Is it, perhaps?

1451
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:45,250
你们持有多少信用违约掉期交易
How many credit default swaps do you own? Hmm?

1452
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,150
但这不代表我是错的
It doesn't make me wrong.

1453
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,360
你是没错
No.

1454
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,590
但这让你们看起来很虚伪
It just makes you a hypocrite.

1455
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:35,200
操
Fuck!

1456
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,410
房贷断供率不断上涨
Mortgage delinquencies went up

1457
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,530
而债权担保凭证居然升值了  难以置信
and the CDOs got more valuable. Unbelievable.

1458
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:40,870
-难以置信  -就是  走势太反常了
- Unbelievable. - We know. It's completely backwards.

1459
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:42,540
我刚给贝尔斯登公司的一位老朋友打电话
I just called an old friend at Bear.

1460
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,290
他连抵押债权是什么都不知道
He didn't even know what a CDO is.

1461
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:48,710
是的  我刚汇给贝尔和德意志七万块
Yeah, I just had to wire Bear and Deutsche $70,000.

1462
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:51,150
这太扯淡了  就像是二加二等于
It's like two plus two equals

1463
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,800
一条鱼
fish.

1464
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,550
这里头有黑幕  我们碰上黑幕了
It's rigged. We bought into a rigged game.

1465
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,430
我们会输个精光
We're gonna lose everything.

1466
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:59,990
然后我不得不搬回家里和我妈住
I'm gonna have to move back in with my mom.

1467
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:01,890
那可不行啊
Can't do that.

1468
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:04,140
我还有个灌肠的预约
All right. Well, I got a colonic appointment.

1469
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,900
等等  本  别挂
Wait a minute. Hold on, Ben.

1470
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,310
本  听着
Ben, look.

1471
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,770
要么是银行还没意识到
Either the banks are clueless

1472
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:12,150
这些抵押债权的真实价值
and they don't know how to value these CDOs,

1473
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:17,260
要么他们都是骗子  拼命掩盖
or they're such crooks that the CDOs are worth shit

1474
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,010
这些债券都是垃圾的真相
and they're hiding it.

1475
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,800
我觉得咱们应该买进更多掉期
I think we should buy more swaps.

1476
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:24,370
你说什么
What?

1477
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,460
闭嘴然后付钱  咱们签过合同的
Suck it up and pay up, fellas. We made a deal.

1478
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,580
不行  不行
No way! No!

1479
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,090
你在逗我吗  还有脸过来
Are you fucking kidding me? You coming here to…

1480
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:32,510
你认真的吗  你觉得这是闹着玩吗
Are you serious? You think this is a game?

1481
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:33,860
不不不
No. No. No. No. No.

1482
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,270
买买买
Yeah. Yeah.

1483
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:43,490
不不不
No! No! No!

1484
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,270
我说真的  一年要洗一次肠
No, seriously, a colonic once a year.

1485
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:46,350
混蛋
Ass!

1486
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,770
你现在还带个跟班了  你个混蛋
And you got a matching little butler boy, you buttfuck!

1487
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,940
-你骂完了吗  -完了
- Are you done? - I think so, yeah.

1488
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,800
天  骂得太起劲不小心闪了腰
God! I pulled a muscle in my back from yelling.

1489
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,720
房贷拖欠率一直在涨
Mortgage defaults have done nothing but go up.

1490
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:07,220
而你给我们的房贷证券报价却更高了
Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds.

1491
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,210
请你解释下  这根本说不通
Please explain that to me. There's no way that makes sense.

1492
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:13,310
你这些掉期交易估算肯定有问题
There's no way you're marking these swaps appropriately.

1493
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,900
我们为什么还要继续和你交易
Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?

1494
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,630
我们达成交易那会
Didn't I say when we made

1495
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:21,800
我有没有说过评级机构  证券交易所委员会
this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC

1496
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,390
以及大银行对即将发生的事都一头雾水
and the big banks were clueless? Didn't I say that?

1497
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:25,770
-说过  -我说过吧
- Yes. - Didn't I say it?

1498
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,700
是的  你说过  确实说过
Yes, you did. You did.

1499
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,270
闭嘴
Shut up.

1500
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:30,310
现在火上身
Now their foot's on fire,

1501
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:32,310
他们反而觉得自己赚到了  你们觉得很意外吗
they think their steak is done, and you're surprised?

1502
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:35,190
这不是愚蠢  是骗局
That's not stupidity. That's fraud.

1503
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,990
愚蠢和犯法就是一个道理
Tell me the difference between stupid and illegal,

1504
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,070
我正要把我的白痴小舅子抓起来
and I'll have my wife's brother arrested.

1505
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:41,970
挺好笑的
That was funny.

1506
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:45,750
我猜你还没意识到整个系统都是一头雾水
I guess you just don't realize how clueless the system really is.

1507
01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:48,160
是  我承认是有些见不得人的举动
Yes, there's some shady shit going down,

1508
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,600
但相信我  这都是愚蠢导致的
but trust me, it's fuelled by stupidity!

1509
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,140
看看你们自己
Look at yourselves.

1510
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,380
你们证明了自己是敢于怀疑的人
You know, you pass yourself off as cynical people

1511
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,840
却还对这个系统抱有希望吗
but you still have some faith in the system, don't you?

1512
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,220
我不抱希望
I don't.

1513
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,180
维尼是明白人  还有谁在乎
Well, except for Vinnie. And who gives a shit?

1514
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,020
-不行  -听着
- No way! - Look...

1515
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,270
要么我们是对的  要么我们大错特错
Either we're right or we're wrong in a giant, giant way.

1516
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,230
若我们错了  我们需要找人
And if we're wrong, then we got to find someone

1517
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:13,940
帮我们脱手这场交易
to help us get out of this trade.

1518
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,780
我现在很难相信我们是对的
I'm not feeling remotely confident that we're right.

1519
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,280
而且万一我们错了  谁会告诉我们
And if we're wrong, who's gonna tell us?

1520
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:23,800
有谁能理解这东西  根本说不通
Who understands this stuff? It makes no sense!

1521
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,040
我觉得咱们需要去拉斯维加斯
I think we need to go to Vegas.

1522
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,290
-拉斯维加斯有什么  -拉斯维加斯吗
- What's in Vegas? - Vegas?

1523
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:32,270
拉斯维加斯怎么了
What the hell's in Las Vegas?

1524
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:36,550
美国证券化论坛下周将在那里召开
The American Securitization Forum is there next week.

1526
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,220
以及掉期的交易员也会到场
and swap trader is gonna be there.

1527
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,050
跟你们说  你们赌的就是那些傻瓜的钱
I'm telling you, your bet is against dumb money.

1528
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:46,970
是时候让你们见识下什么叫人傻钱多
It's about time you find out just how dumb that money really is.

1529
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:48,200
天  我讨厌拉斯维加斯
God, I hate Vegas.

1530
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,730
听说那里的食物不错
I hear the food has gotten really good in Vegas.

1531
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,310
现在也有一家松久日料餐厅了
They have a Nobu now.

1532
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:52,790
你能不能消停会
Would you fucking stop it?

优选公司总裁保罗·丹托纳: 房贷市场十分稳健  日益壮大

1539
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:40,380
有什么感觉吗
Any sense?

1540
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,040
如果一个债券很贵  是什么意思
And if a bond is "Rich”, it is...

1541
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:44,010
不知道  包含的资产很多吗
I don't know, loaded with assets?

1542
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:45,450
贵的意思就是定价过高
"Rich" Just means overpriced.

1543
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:47,490
我在飞机上睡不着  所以做了点准备
I can't sleep on planes, so I did my homework.

1544
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:49,990
集中精神  咱们的目标是什么
Okay, let's focus. What's our goal?

1545
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:52,410
来弄清楚这到底是千载难逢的机遇
To figure out if this is a deal of a lifetime

1546
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,290
还是我们漏了什么不知道的细节
or if everyone here knows something we don't

1547
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:56,210
然后亏得一文不剩
and we're gonna get royally screwed.

1548
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:59,060
对  见到贝尔斯登公司的人时牢记这点
Right. Remember that when you meet with the guys from Bear.

1549
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:00,960
我给你们安排了一次面谈
I set you up with a face-to-face.

1550

-好棒  -在哪里
- Awesome. - Where is that?

1551
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,760
天  五年前证券化论坛是个屌丝聚?
Holy shit. Five years ago, Securitization was a loser convention.

1552
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,950
也就一两百人会到场
100, maybe 200 people would show.

1553

规模达五千亿的一年后  变成现在这样
$500 billion a year later, you get this.

1554
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,930
这里有不少爱装逼的人
There's a lot of smug-looking people in here, huh?

1555
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:14,130
一个个暴发户
It's like someone hit a

1556
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:16,480
装的像出身贵族似的
piniata filled with white people who suck at golf.

1557
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,060
这些小丑都是什么来头
I mean, who are all these clowns?

1558
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,520
-别这样  我觉得看着挺好玩  -闭嘴
- Oh, come on. I think it looks fun. - Shut up.

1559
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,820
那肯定啊  温尼特说了
Certainly. Vennett says

1560
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,070
咱们赚的可都是这些人的钱
these are the people we're betting against.

1561

先生们
Gentlemen.

1564
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:29,760
我们什么时候才有机会
When do we get a chance

1565
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,120
与这里的人们面谈呢
to face time with some of these lovely folks?

1566
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:33,640
克里斯  把门卡给他
Chris, give him the keycards.

1567
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,960
你知道要给哪些门卡吗
Do you even know which keycards you're giving out?

1568
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,040
-注意点别给错了  -谢谢
- You're just giving them out? - Thank you.

1569

I had two poached eggs

面谈  我想要面谈
Face time. I'd like some face time.

1576

记住  我们来这是为了收集信息
Just remember. We're here to gather information.

1577
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,720
我们是来获取情报的  好吗
We're gathering information, okay?

1578
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:54,180
不是来大肆宣扬我们的立场  明白吗
We're not advertising our short position. All right?

1579
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,890
我们不希望打草惊蛇  能做到吗
We don't want to spook everybody. Can you do that?

1580
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,520
我知道你容易说漏嘴  还停不下来
I know you got a big mouth, you like to run it.

1581
01:12:57,620 --> 01:12:59,360
这几天能不能收敛下
Can you just keep it shut for a few days?

1582
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,560
好吧  好吧
Okay. Okay.

1583
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,500
别担心  我们会好好干的
Yeah, don't worry. We'll play nice.

1584
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,900
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen.

1585

利润丰厚
Profits are strong

1587
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,700
而房贷还会继续成为
and the mortgage continues to be the bedrock

1588
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,140
整个经济体系的中流砥柱
on which this economy is built.

1589
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,380
是  去年我们不得不承担
And, yes, we had to take some losses

1590
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,750
在次贷市场带来的损失  但是
in our subprime department last year, but those losses

1591
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:25,480
损失将会被保持在5%以内
will be contained at only 5%.

1592
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:27,760
现在  在住房地产业
Now, in our residential sector...

1593
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,030
马克  还没到问答时间
Mark, it's not a Q and A.

1594
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:30,800
我们推出的可调利率房贷产品
...our rollout of those variable rate packages

1595
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,530
已被消费者一抢而空
were gobbled up by the consumers!

1596
01:13:32,650 --> 01:13:34,700
我有一个问题
I have a question, please.

1597
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:39,730
先生  问答环节是在我讲话结束后
Sir, the Q and A is after my statements.

1598
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:42,230
但看你很急的样子  请问吧
But you know what? You seem anxious. How can I help you?

1599
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:44,230
-谢谢  你好吗  -很好  谢谢
- Thank you. How are you? - Fine, thank you.

1600
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:47,440
你觉得次贷亏损
Would you say that it is a possibility

1601
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:52,170
止步于5%的可能性有多大
or a probability that subprime losses stop at 5%?

1602
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:53,450
谢谢
Thank you.

1603
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:58,350
可能性非常大
I would say it is a very strong probability, indeed.

1604
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:01,390
那么  回到房地产市场
So back to the residential sector.

1605
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,590
我们推出新的浮动利率产品时
When we rolled out the new variable rates package...

1606
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:06,190
打断一下
Excuse me.

1607
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:08,760
请讲
Yes, sir.

1608
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:12,240
零  零
Zero! Zero!

1609
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,100
次贷亏损止于5%
There is a 0% chance

1610
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,980
的可能性是零
that your subprime losses will stop at 5%.

1611
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,140
零
Zero.

1612
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,770
不好意思
Excuse me.

1613
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:22,900
我得接个电话
I have to take this.

1614
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,940
他肯定是美国银行的
He must be from Bank of America.

1615
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:27,860
我们的次贷部门没事
Our subprime department is fine.

他提问了  他还接了电话
He said that, he took the call.

Now you see what I had to deal with?

1658
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:06,500
我们不调查房贷债券
Oh, we don't investigate mortgage bonds.

1659
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,120
其实  因为预算缩减

You're pricing the swaps like the bond is gonna collapse

可实际上大多只有25%

有些根本就没有
Some of them are 0%!

1722
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:08,620

We also know that if the bottom tranches fail at over 8%,

1723
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:09,870
那高级份额就会受影响
the upper tranches are affected.

1724
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,180
它们会变成零
They go to zero.

1725
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:14,390
我敢打赌现在那些AA其实更像B

收益是

200比1
is 200 to 1.

1731
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,070
但他们只看面值的评级
But they're all taking the ratings at face value.

1732
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:28,980
所以他们对AA份额
So they're charging pennies

1733
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:30,570
只会收很少的溢价
on the dollar a bet against the AA's.

1734
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,020
你们和我想的一样天真
Just when I start thinking you guys are clowns...

1735
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,600

No one on the planet's betting against AA's.

1736
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,610
银行会以为我们不是喝大就是抽风了
The banks will think we're either high or having a stroke.

1737
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:43,040
他们会收下我们交的每一分溢价
They'll take every dime we have to offer.

But we did.

不是吧  为什么
Come on, guys, what's the angle?

1745
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:06,440
不为什么  我们是新手  有点兴奋
Oh, got no angle. We're new to this. We're just excited.

1760
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,100
我们应该庆祝一下
We should celebrate.

1761
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,100
你们刚才是在跟美国经济对赌
You just bet against the American economy.

1762
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,690
没错  我们赌了
Fuck, yeah, we did!

1763
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:00,730
也就是说
Which means...

1764
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:03,500
也就是说要是我们对了
Which means if we're right...

1765
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:06,640
要是我们对了  人们会无家可归
If we're right, people lose homes.

1766
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:07,900
人们会失去工作
People lose jobs.

1767
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,500
人们会失去退休存款
People lose retirement savings.

1768
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:11,170
人们会失去养老金
People lose pensions.

1769
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,450
你们知道我最讨厌银行业的是什么吗
You know what I hate about fucking banking?

1770
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:14,080
它把人变成了数字  这里有个数字
It reduces people to numbers. Here's a number.

1771
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,440
失业率每上升1%
Every 1% unemployment goes up,

1772
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,000
就有4万人死亡  你知道吗
40,000 people die. Did you know that?

1773
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,580
-不知道  -你知道吗
- No. - Did you know that?

1774
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,270
不  我不知道
No, I didn't know that.

1775
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,390
我们只是很兴奋
We were just excited.

1776
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:27,810
别他妈再跳舞了
Just don't fucking dance.

1777
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,320
-好吧  -你要去哪儿
- All right. - Where are you going?

1778
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,870
刚才真是吓坏宝宝了
Whoa, I just got really scared.

1779
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:40,310
首先  今天表现不错
First of all, great show today.

1780
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:41,850
-你太出色了  -谢谢啊
- You were terrific. - Thank you.

1781
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,560
你的大嘴就是关不牢啊
Your big mouth was a revelation.

1782
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,370
谢谢你的夸奖
I appreciate that.

1783
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,230
你担心你和你的掉期会被耍是吗
You worried you and your swaps are getting played?

1784
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:48,560
这次你有机会
Well, this is an opportunity

1785
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,450
认识你的赌局对手了
for you to meet who you're betting against.

1786
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,320
尽量别太正义  听着点
Try not to get too righteous and listen a little.

1787
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,800
好吧  这位是谁
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?

1788
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,590
一个十足的混蛋
A real solid-gold asshole.

1789
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,840
我是个债务担保经理
I'm a CDO manager.

1790
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:57,990
债务担保经理
A "CDO manager"?

1791
01:22:58,090 --> 01:22:59,510
在哈丁顾问公司工作
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.

1792
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:03,220
我不知道债务担保还要人管呢
I didn't realize that there was anything to manage with CDOs.

1793
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:05,190
是吗
Oh.

1794
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,460
我们选择加入债务担保组合的有价证券
We select the securities that go into the CDO portfolio

1795
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,920
同时监控这些资产
and monitor the assets.

1796
01:23:10,020 --> 01:23:11,800
美林证券公司的债务担保多由我负责
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.

1797
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,840
你代表投资人还是美林证券
Do you represent the investors or Merrill Lynch?

1798
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:15,970
投资人
The investors.

1799
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:17,100
是吗
You do.

1800
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,530
-没错  -可是
- Yeah. - But...

1801
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:20,600
你若不把美林证券的债券放进你的债务担保里
Merrill Lynch isn't gonna send you any customers

1802
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:24,250
美林就不会给你任何客户
unless you put Merrill Lynch's bonds in your CDO.

1803
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:28,080
好问题  我们这么说吧
Good question. Let's just say Merrill and I have, um...

1804
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:30,790
我和美林关系不错
We have a good relationship.

1805
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,110
你跟美林证券关系不错
You have a good relationship with Merrill Lynch.

1806
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:34,860
我们合作很久了
We've been doing business together for a long time.

1807
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,430
所以你发行的债务担保
And so the CDOs that you create

1808
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:41,450
是质量最好价值最高的
are of the highest quality and the highest value.

1809
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,460
-绝对的  -绝对的
- Absolutely. Yep. - Absolutely.

1810
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,100
你们关心不断上升的信用违约率吗
Are you at all concerned about the rising default rates?

1811
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:52,230
我相信这些产品没有风险  马克
I assume no risk for these products myself, Mark.

1812
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,070
好
Okay.

1813
01:23:57,650 --> 01:24:00,820
我们再说直白一些  银行找你
So let me get this straight. The bank calls you up.

1814
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:02,930
他们给你他们想卖的债券
They give you the bonds they want to sell.

1815
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:04,350
他们给你客户
They give you clients,

1816
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:06,810
他们给你钱经营你的生意
they give you money to run your business.

1817
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,610
给你丰厚的报酬
Give you fat fees for doing so.

1818
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,710
可你代表的是投资人
But you represent the investors?

1819
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,290
是这样的吗
Is that right?

1820
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,450
没错
Yeah.

1821
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:15,990
可我们现在不在美林证券的大楼里
But we're not in the Merrill Lynch building.

1822
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:17,660
-好  那你在哪儿  -我们在新泽西
- Okay. Where are you? - We're in New Jersey.

1823
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,830
只有20分钟的距离
You're 20 minutes away.

1824
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,850
要是坐直升机就只有5分钟
Well, five if you use a helicopter.

1825
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,850
这很可笑吗
That's funny, huh?

1826
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:26,140
可笑至极
That's hilarious.

1827
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:30,400
天哪
Oh, boy.

1828
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:32,960
你老板要炸了
Your boss is about to explode.

1829
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,670
不  他好奇心太强  炸不了
No, he's too curious to explode.

1830
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,220
等等  再说一遍
Hold on. Say that again.

1831
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,430
债务担保A包含B的一部分
CDO "A" Has parts of CDO "B".

1832
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:40,430
但是B又包含A的一部分
And CDO "B" Has parts of CDO "A".

1833
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:42,770
而它们又被放进了C里
But then they both get put inside CDO "C".

1834
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:44,600
对  那叫债务担保的平方
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.

1835
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:46,790
债务担保的担保
A CDO of a CDO.

1836
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,200
明白吗
All right?

1837
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:50,320
还有一种债务担保
And then there's CDOs made up of the opposite side

1838
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,960
赌的是你和你掉期交易的输赢
of the bet you made with your swaps.

1839
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:54,500
我们叫综合性债务担保
We call them synthetic CDOs.

1840
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,780
你说什么  综合性债务担保
What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.

1841
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,590
这太他妈疯狂了
That is fucking crazy.

1842
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,380
不疯狂  相反  它超厉害
It's not. It's awesome.

1843
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,360
他要怒了
His face is starting to boil.

1844

He looks like the bad guy from Dune.

01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:27,270
1亿美元
A billion dollars.

What?

01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,770
要是迈克尔·柏利发现的

01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:32,830
房贷债券是火柴

1856
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,650
担保房贷债券的市场
How much bigger is the market for insuring mortgage bonds

1857
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:38,210
要比实际房贷大多少
than actual mortgages?

1858
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:40,550
大约20倍
About 20 times.

1859
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,780
要是房贷债券是火柴
If the mortgage bonds were the match

1860
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,580
债务担保是吸饱煤油的抹布
and the CDOs were the kerosene-soaked rags,

1861
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,710
综合性债务担保就是喝醉了的
then the synthetic CDO was the atomic bomb

1873
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:21,990
假如我在一局21点中赌1000万美元
Let's say I bet $10 million on a blackjack hand.

1874
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:24,590
1000万美元是因为这一局代表
$10 million because this hand is meant to represent

1875
01:26:24,970 --> 01:26:27,220
一个房贷债券
a single mortgage bond.

我怎么会输呢  对吗
How could I lose, right?

1884
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,060
这就是个经典的错误
Now, this is a classic error.

1885
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:53,100
在篮球中这叫热手谬误

运动员连续投球命中

1887

人们确信他们会投中下一个
People are sure they're gonna make the next one.

1888
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:00,150
人们认为现在发生的一切
People think that whatever's happening now

1889
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:02,990
将来还会继续发生
is gonna continue to happen into the future.

1890
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:06,410
在房地产繁荣时期  市场持续火热
During the real estate boom, markets were going up and up

1891
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:08,160
人们就认为房价再也不会下跌
and people thought they would never go down.

1892
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,790
所以有些人边观察边想
So people who are watching and think that I won't lose

1893
01:27:10,890 --> 01:27:12,330
我不会输  然后开始下注
will make a side bet.

You know what they're doing, right?

2050
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,630
是啊  他们在卸货
Yeah. They're unloading them.

2051
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:52,010
他们先卖担保债务凭证  然后换家银行
They're selling their dog shit CDOs, then they go to another bank

2052
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:54,160
把他们刚卖掉的东西做空
And short the shit they just fucking sold!

2053
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:55,890
我们去找媒体吧  兄弟

写篇文章  题目就叫《我们都玩完了》
Do you want me to write a piece called "We're All Fucked"?

而且在卖出去之前他们是不会主动降价的
And they won't devalue them until they get them off their books.

2066

我花了好几年才在华尔街有了这人脉
It took me years to build my relationships on Wall Street.

2070

银行和评级机构不会确认这样的消息
No bank or ratings agency is going to confirm a story like this

2071
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:39,910
就因为两个来自基金开在车库的家伙
just because it comes from two guys in a...

2072
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:43,290
觉得世界末日要到了
Sorry, garage band hedge fund that thinks it's the apocalypse.

2073

我以为你是有良心的  凯西
I thought you were for real, Casey.

2074
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:48,790
我真的是这么想的
You know, I'll have to say I really did.

2075
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,050
是吗
Really?

2076
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,360
杰米  你要跟一个小孩才三岁
Yeah, Jamie, you try being for real with a three-year-old

2077
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:54,300
老婆在读硕士的人谈良心

是啊  凯西  我一直对你很不爽来着
Yeah, Casey. I've always hated you,

2082
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:07,880
因为你在大学里那臭屁样儿
because you were a prick in college

2083
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:10,320
到今天也还是没变
and you are a prick today!

我是马克·鲍姆  给我回电

2087
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:19,480
次级贷债券大跳水

传闻说有大批违约
Rumor has it the default numbers are huge.

2089
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:24,400
是谁先拿到汇款数据的  我猜是高盛
Who got the remittance data early? I bet it's Goldman.

2090
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:25,810
滚你的
Yeah, fuck you very much.

2091
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:28,750

没人会买担保凭证和抵押债券了
Well, nobody's buying CDO or mortgage bonds anymore

2096
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:42,510

2099
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:48,590
我听人说  别人又听人说
I heard from somebody who heard from somebody...

2100
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:51,400
不  亚历克斯  出去  抱歉
No, Alex, no. Sorry.

2101
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:56,390
摩根的本尼·克里格

2105
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,950
可能是时候穿上救生衣跑路了

2106

2107
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,250
真是操蛋啊
I'm jacked! I'm jacked to the tits!

2108

好
Good.

2109

2114
01:40:28,350 --> 01:40:30,770
他们又变卦了  是不是
They're singing a different tune now, aren't they?

2115
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:33,610
情况不妙
That's not good.

2116
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:39,810
等会再说  现在不行
Maybe later. Not now.

2117
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:42,280
-这是开玩笑的吧  -绝对不要
- This is a joke. - Never.

2118
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:46,870
我在听
Listening.

2119
01:40:47,290 --> 01:40:48,860
-柏利博士吗  -是的
-Dr. Burry? - Yeah.

2120
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,360
我是高盛投资公司的狄·温斯顿
Deeb Winston, Goldman Sachs.

2121
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,940
是这样  我看了下你给的价位
Listen, I've been reviewing your position.

2122
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,280
想跟你讨论一下  确保它们是合理的
I wanted to discuss your marks and make sure they're fair.

2123
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:57,200
那我想你们也已经
Yeah, I think you mean that you've

2124
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:00,050
给自己留好了净空头仓位
secured a net short position yourselves.

2125
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,970
这样你就可以随意给我的掉期信贷估价了
So you're free to mark my swaps accurately for once

2126
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:05,810
因为现在已经任你宰割了
because it's now in your interest to do so.

2127
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,060
我不知道你想让我说什么
I'm not sure what you want me to say.

2128
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:11,730
我想
I think that...

2129
01:41:13,230 --> 01:41:15,320
我想你已经说出来了
I think that you've already said it.

2130
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,270
你跟高盛的杰夫说我是不会转移基金的
You tell Jeff at Goldman that I'm not transferring funds.

2131
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:26,990
真是胡扯
This is bullshit!

2132
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:35,920
好的  我们等下再谈
Okay, we'll talk later.

2133
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:37,840
谢谢你
Thank you.

2134
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:42,200
谢谢你来的这么快  马克
Thanks for coming so quickly, Mark.

2135
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:45,160
我知道你最近听到了
I know you've been hearing rumblings

2136
01:41:45,260 --> 01:41:46,750
摩根受损的一些消息

不错
Yes.

2141
01:41:57,690 --> 01:41:59,030
非常好
Tons.

2142
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,860
我只是想跟你说
I just wanted you to know that, um...

2143
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,100
的确  摩根的确有所损失
that, yes, Morgan has suffered some losses,

2144
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:07,990
但我们的流动资金相当充足  不必担心
but our liquidity is strong and there's no cause for concern.

2145
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,040
本尼·克里格会担心吗
Would Bennie Cleager be concerned?

2146
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:12,690
因为传闻说
Because word on the street

2147
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:15,630
他的损失也不小
is that he took some pretty heavy losses.

2148
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,740
凯西  拜托  我们已经很熟了
Kathy, come on. We know each other.

2149
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:21,050
发生什么事了
What's going on?

2150
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:22,970
情况有多糟
How bad is this?

2151
01:42:23,130 --> 01:42:24,300
好吧
Okay.

2152
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:28,120
两年前  本尼·克里格在摩根的债券部门
Two years ago, Bennie Cleager in Morgan's bond department

2153
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:31,750
也在做空次级房贷  二十亿做空3B级公司
also started shorting subprime housing, $2 billion in BBBs.

2154
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:33,090
本尼比我想的要聪明
Bennie is smarter than I thought.

2155
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:34,590
不  一点都不聪明
No, he's not smart at all.

2156
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:37,050
掉期信贷的溢价吃掉了他的利润
The premiums on the swap ate into his desk's profit.

2157
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:39,090
为了掩饰他在BBB的做空
To cover his BBB shorts,

2158
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,680
他卖了很多A级和AA级掉期来自保
he sold a lot of A and AA swaps as protection.

2159
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:42,780
非常多
A lot.

2160
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:46,660
他相信它们是不会被影响到的
He believed that there was no way that they could be affected.

2161
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,580
告诉我摩根斯坦利没有这些互换信贷的合同
Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn't hold the contracts on these swaps.

2162
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:55,420
操
Holy shit.

2163
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,240
这段时间我一直都
All this time I've been

2164
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,500
在想我到底在跟谁赌
trying to figure out who I'm betting against,

2165
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:01,590
没想到是摩根斯坦利
and it's Morgan Stanley.

2166
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:03,880
也就是我自己
Which is me.

2167
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:07,930
风险敞口是多少  三十亿吗
What's your exposure? $3 billion?

2168
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:10,680
拜托  别跟我说超过四十亿了
Please, don't tell me it's more than four.

2169
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:12,460
我不能回答  我不能回答你
I can't answer that. I can't answer that.

2170
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,710
可以的  你说的出的  因为我走进这里
Yes, you can answer that, because I walk in here

2171
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:18,900
看到你手下的人都在走廊里哭天喊地的
and people are crying in your hallway.

2172
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:20,440
凯西
Kathy,

2173
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:22,970
你把我带进来然后告诉我没事的
you bring me in to tell me everything's fine,

2174
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:24,280
但根本不是这样
and everything's not fine.

2175
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:26,820
到底  发生什么事了
What, what is happening?

2176
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:31,200
多头敞口是
The long exposure is...

2177
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,620
150亿
...$15 billion.

2178
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:41,700
老天爷啊
Jesus!

2179
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:44,160
他一直说违约金不可能超过8%的
He kept saying defaults over 8% were impossible.

2180
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:45,240
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

2181
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:46,550
还说会有100万人无家可归呢
That there would be a million homeless!

2182
01:43:48,010 --> 01:43:50,260
是啊  但我们跟摩根斯坦利可没关系
Yeah, but we have nothing to do with Morgan Stanley.

2183
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,480
告诉破产法院
Tell the bankruptcy court.

2184
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:59,860
如果摩根破产  我们的钱就都归他们了
Morgan fails, all our accounts go on their balance sheet.

2185
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,110
真是疯了
It's just crazy.

2186
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,630
摩根自己打的烂赌
Morgan makes the sucker's bet

2187
01:44:03,730 --> 01:44:06,070
要我们替他还赌债
and we pay their fucking gambling debt?

2188
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:09,070
做空银行股  然后等
Short the bank stocks. Then we wait.

2189
01:44:12,990 --> 01:44:15,000
或者等市场开  卖掉我们的掉期信贷
Or we sell our swaps when the market opens.

2190
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:19,780
我们拿奖金  投资人拿收益
We get our bonuses, our investors get their profits, we get...

2191
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:22,380
我们能拿到30%  凑活了
What, 30 cents on the dollar? It's not bad.

2192
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:24,150
我们值三倍好嘛
We're three times that.

国会被迫拆分大银行

2502

并规范贷款与衍生品市场
